    Sec. 151. Definitions; short title

-STATUTE-
      When used in this chapter and for the purposes of this chapter - 
      First. The term "carrier" includes any railroad subject to the
    jurisdiction of the Surface Transportation Board, any express
    company that would have been subject to subtitle IV of title 49, as
    of December 31, 1995,,(!1) and any company which is directly or
    indirectly owned or controlled by or under common control with any
    carrier by railroad and which operates any equipment or facilities
    or performs any service (other than trucking service) in connection
    with the transportation, receipt, delivery, elevation, transfer in
    transit, refrigeration or icing, storage, and handling of property
    transported by railroad, and any receiver, trustee, or other
    individual or body, judicial or otherwise, when in the possession
    of the business of any such "carrier": Provided, however, That the
    term "carrier" shall not include any street, interurban, or
    suburban electric railway, unless such railway is operating as a
    part of a general steam-railroad system of transportation, but
    shall not exclude any part of the general steam-railroad system of
    transportation now or hereafter operated by any other motive power.
    The Surface Transportation Board is authorized and directed upon
    request of the Mediation Board or upon complaint of any party
    interested to determine after hearing whether any line operated by
    electric power falls within the terms of this proviso. The term
    "carrier" shall not include any company by reason of its being
    engaged in the mining of coal, the supplying of coal to a carrier
    where delivery is not beyond the mine tipple, and the operation of
    equipment or facilities therefor, or in any of such activities.

      Second. The term "Adjustment Board" means the National Railroad
    Adjustment Board created by this chapter.
      Third. The term "Mediation Board" means the National Mediation

    and any foreign nation, or between any Territory or the District of
    Columbia and any State, or between any Territory and any other
    Territory, or between any Territory and the District of Columbia,
    or within any Territory or the District of Columbia, or between
    points in the same State but through any other State or any
    Territory or the District of Columbia or any foreign nation.
      Fifth. The term "employee" as used herein includes every person
    in the service of a carrier (subject to its continuing authority to
    supervise and direct the manner of rendition of his service) who
    performs any work defined as that of an employee or subordinate
    official in the orders of the Surface Transportation Board now in
    effect, and as the same may be amended or interpreted by orders
    hereafter entered by the Board pursuant to the authority which is
    conferred upon it to enter orders amending or interpreting such
    existing orders: Provided, however, That no occupational
    classification made by order of the Surface Transportation Board
    shall be construed to define the crafts according to which railway
    employees may be organized by their voluntary action, nor shall the
    jurisdiction or powers of such employee organizations be regarded
    as in any way limited or defined by the provisions of this chapter
    or by the orders of the Board.
      The term "employee" shall not include any individual while such
    individual is engaged in the physical operations consisting of the
    mining of coal, the preparation of coal, the handling (other than
    movement by rail with standard railroad locomotives) of coal not
    beyond the mine tipple, or the loading of coal at the tipple.
      Sixth. The term "representative" means any person or persons,
    labor union, organization, or corporation designated either by a
    carrier or group of carriers or by its or their employees, to act
    for it or them.
      Seventh. The term "district court" includes the United States
    District Court for the District of Columbia; and the term "court of
    appeals" includes the United States Court of Appeals for the
    District of Columbia.
      This chapter may be cited as the "Railway Labor Act."

    TITLE 45 - RAILROADS
    CHAPTER 8 - RAILWAY LABOR
    SUBCHAPTER I - GENERAL PROVISIONS

-HEAD-
    Sec. 152. General duties

-STATUTE-
    First. Duty of carriers and employees to settle disputes
      It shall be the duty of all carriers, their officers, agents, and
    employees to exert every reasonable effort to make and maintain
    agreements concerning rates of pay, rules, and working conditions,
    and to settle all disputes, whether arising out of the application
    of such agreements or otherwise, in order to avoid any interruption
    to commerce or to the operation of any carrier growing out of any
    dispute between the carrier and the employees thereof.
    Second. Consideration of disputes by representatives
      All disputes between a carrier or carriers and its or their
    employees shall be considered, and, if possible, decided, with all
    expedition, in conference between representatives designated and
    authorized so to confer, respectively, by the carrier or carriers
    and by the employees thereof interested in the dispute.
    Third. Designation of representatives
      Representatives, for the purposes of this chapter, shall be
    designated by the respective parties without interference,
    influence, or coercion by either party over the designation of
    representatives by the other; and neither party shall in any way
    interfere with, influence, or coerce the other in its choice of
    representatives. Representatives of employees for the purposes of
    this chapter need not be persons in the employ of the carrier, and
    no carrier shall, by interference, influence, or coercion seek in
    any manner to prevent the designation by its employees as their
    representatives of those who or which are not employees of the
    carrier.
    Fourth. Organization and collective bargaining; freedom from
      interference by carrier; assistance in organizing or maintaining
      organization by carrier forbidden; deduction of dues from wages
      forbidden
      Employees shall have the right to organize and bargain
    collectively through representatives of their own choosing. The
    majority of any craft or class of employees shall have the right to
    determine who shall be the representative of the craft or class for
    the purposes of this chapter. No carrier, its officers, or agents
    shall deny or in any way question the right of its employees to
    join, organize, or assist in organizing the labor organization of
    their choice, and it shall be unlawful for any carrier to interfere
    in any way with the organization of its employees, or to use the
    funds of the carrier in maintaining or assisting or contributing to
    any labor organization, labor representative, or other agency of
    collective bargaining, or in performing any work therefor, or to
    influence or coerce employees in an effort to induce them to join
    or remain or not to join or remain members of any labor
    organization, or to deduct from the wages of employees any dues,
    fees, assessments, or other contributions payable to labor
    organizations, or to collect or to assist in the collection of any
    such dues, fees, assessments, or other contributions: Provided,
    That nothing in this chapter shall be construed to prohibit a
    carrier from permitting an employee, individually, or local
    representatives of employees from conferring with management during
    working hours without loss of time, or to prohibit a carrier from
    furnishing free transportation to its employees while engaged in
    the business of a labor organization.
    Fifth. Agreements to join or not to join labor organizations
      forbidden
      No carrier, its officers, or agents shall require any person
    seeking employment to sign any contract or agreement promising to
    join or not to join a labor organization; and if any such contract
    has been enforced prior to the effective date of this chapter, then
    such carrier shall notify the employees by an appropriate order
    that such contract has been discarded and is no longer binding on
    them in any way.
    Sixth. Conference of representatives; time; place; private
      agreements
      In case of a dispute between a carrier or carriers and its or
    their employees, arising out of grievances or out of the
    interpretation or application of agreements concerning rates of
    pay, rules, or working conditions, it shall be the duty of the
    designated representative or representatives of such carrier or
    carriers and of such employees, within ten days after the receipt
    of notice of a desire on the part of either party to confer in
    respect to such dispute, to specify a time and place at which such
    conference shall be held: Provided, (1) That the place so specified
    shall be situated upon the line of the carrier involved or as
    otherwise mutually agreed upon; and (2) that the time so specified
    shall allow the designated conferees reasonable opportunity to
    reach such place of conference, but shall not exceed twenty days
    from the receipt of such notice: And provided further, That nothing
    in this chapter shall be construed to supersede the provisions of
    any agreement (as to conferences) then in effect between the
    parties.
    Seventh. Change in pay, rules, or working conditions contrary to
      agreement or to section 156 forbidden
      No carrier, its officers, or agents shall change the rates of
    pay, rules, or working conditions of its employees, as a class, as
    embodied in agreements except in the manner prescribed in such
    agreements or in section 156 of this title.
    Eighth. Notices of manner of settlement of disputes; posting
      Every carrier shall notify its employees by printed notices in
    such form and posted at such times and places as shall be specified
    by the Mediation Board that all disputes between the carrier and
    its employees will be handled in accordance with the requirements
    of this chapter, and in such notices there shall be printed
    verbatim, in large type, the third, fourth, and fifth paragraphs of
    this section. The provisions of said paragraphs are made a part of
    the contract of employment between the carrier and each employee,
    and shall be held binding upon the parties, regardless of any other
    express or implied agreements between them.
    Ninth. Disputes as to identity of representatives; designation by
      Mediation Board; secret elections
      If any dispute shall arise among a carrier's employees as to who
    are the representatives of such employees designated and authorized
    in accordance with the requirements of this chapter, it shall be
    the duty of the Mediation Board, upon request of either party to
    the dispute, to investigate such dispute and to certify to both
    parties, in writing, within thirty days after the receipt of the
    invocation of its services, the name or names of the individuals or
    organizations that have been designated and authorized to represent
    the employees involved in the dispute, and certify the same to the
    carrier. Upon receipt of such certification the carrier shall treat
    with the representative so certified as the representative of the
    craft or class for the purposes of this chapter. In such an
    investigation, the Mediation Board shall be authorized to take a
    secret ballot of the employees involved, or to utilize any other
    appropriate method of ascertaining the names of their duly
    designated and authorized representatives in such manner as shall
    insure the choice of representatives by the employees without
    interference, influence, or coercion exercised by the carrier. In
    the conduct of any election for the purposes herein indicated the
    Board shall designate who may participate in the election and
    establish the rules to govern the election, or may appoint a
    committee of three neutral persons who after hearing shall within
    ten days designate the employees who may participate in the
    election. The Board shall have access to and have power to make
    copies of the books and records of the carriers to obtain and
    utilize such information as may be deemed necessary by it to carry
    out the purposes and provisions of this paragraph.
    Tenth. Violations; prosecution and penalties
      The willful failure or refusal of any carrier, its officers or
    agents, to comply with the terms of the third, fourth, fifth,
    seventh, or eighth paragraph of this section shall be a
    misdemeanor, and upon conviction thereof the carrier, officer, or
    agent offending shall be subject to a fine of not less than $1,000,
    nor more than $20,000, or imprisonment for not more than six
    months, or both fine and imprisonment, for each offense, and each
    day during which such carrier, officer, or agent shall willfully
    fail or refuse to comply with the terms of the said paragraphs of
    this section shall constitute a separate offense. It shall be the
    duty of any United States attorney to whom any duly designated
    representative of a carrier's employees may apply to institute in
    the proper court and to prosecute under the direction of the
    Attorney General of the United States, all necessary proceedings
    for the enforcement of the provisions of this section, and for the
    punishment of all violations thereof and the costs and expenses of
    such prosecution shall be paid out of the appropriation for the
    expenses of the courts of the United States: Provided, That nothing
    in this chapter shall be construed to require an individual
    employee to render labor or service without his consent, nor shall
    anything in this chapter be construed to make the quitting of his
    labor by an individual employee an illegal act; nor shall any court
    issue any process to compel the performance by an individual
    employee of such labor or service, without his consent.
    Eleventh. Union security agreements; check-off
      Notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter, or of any
    other statute or law of the United States, or Territory thereof, or
    of any State, any carrier or carriers as defined in this chapter
    and a labor organization or labor organizations duly designated and
    authorized to represent employees in accordance with the
    requirements of this chapter shall be permitted - 
        (a) to make agreements, requiring, as a condition of continued
      employment, that within sixty days following the beginning of
      such employment, or the effective date of such agreements,
      whichever is the later, all employees shall become members of the
      labor organization representing their craft or class: Provided,
      That no such agreement shall require such condition of employment
      with respect to employees to whom membership is not available
      upon the same terms and conditions as are generally applicable to
      any other member or with respect to employees to whom membership
      was denied or terminated for any reason other than the failure of
      the employee to tender the periodic dues, initiation fees, and
      assessments (not including fines and penalties) uniformly
      required as a condition of acquiring or retaining membership.
        (b) to make agreements providing for the deduction by such
      carrier or carriers from the wages of its or their employees in a
      craft or class and payment to the labor organization representing
      the craft or class of such employees, of any periodic dues,
      initiation fees, and assessments (not including fines and
      penalties) uniformly required as a condition of acquiring or
      retaining membership: Provided, That no such agreement shall be
      effective with respect to any individual employee until he shall
      have furnished the employer with a written assignment to the
      labor organization of such membership dues, initiation fees, and
      assessments, which shall be revocable in writing after the
      expiration of one year or upon the termination date of the
      applicable collective agreement, whichever occurs sooner.
        (c) The requirement of membership in a labor organization in an
      agreement made pursuant to subparagraph (a) of this paragraph
      shall be satisfied, as to both a present or future employee in
      engine, train, yard, or hostling service, that is, an employee
      engaged in any of the services or capacities covered in the First
      division of paragraph (h) of section 153 of this title defining
      the jurisdictional scope of the First Division of the National
      Railroad Adjustment Board, if said employee shall hold or acquire
      membership in any one of the labor organizations, national in
      scope, organized in accordance with this chapter and admitting to
      membership employees of a craft or class in any of said services;
      and no agreement made pursuant to subparagraph (b) of this
      paragraph shall provide for deductions from his wages for
      periodic dues, initiation fees, or assessments payable to any
      labor organization other than that in which he holds membership:
      Provided, however, That as to an employee in any of said services
      on a particular carrier at the effective date of any such
      agreement on a carrier, who is not a member of any one of the
      labor organizations, national in scope, organized in accordance
      with this chapter and admitting to membership employees of a
      craft or class in any of said services, such employee, as a
      condition of continuing his employment, may be required to become
      a member of the organization representing the craft in which he
      is employed on the effective date of the first agreement
      applicable to him: Provided, further, That nothing herein or in
      any such agreement or agreements shall prevent an employee from
      changing membership from one organization to another organization
      admitting to membership employees of a craft or class in any of
      said services.
        (d) Any provisions in paragraphs Fourth and Fifth of this
      section in conflict herewith are to the extent of such conflict
      amended.

    Sec. 153. National Railroad Adjustment Board

-STATUTE-
    First. Establishment; composition; powers and duties; divisions;
      hearings and awards; judicial review
      There is established a Board, to be known as the "National
    Railroad Adjustment Board", the members of which shall be selected
    within thirty days after June 21, 1934, and it is provided - 
      (a) That the said Adjustment Board shall consist of thirty-four
    members, seventeen of whom shall be selected by the carriers and
    seventeen by such labor organizations of the employees, national in
    scope, as have been or may be organized in accordance with the
    provisions of sections 151a and 152 of this title.
      (b) The carriers, acting each through its board of directors or
    its receiver or receivers, trustee or trustees, or through an
    officer or officers designated for that purpose by such board,
    trustee or trustees, or receiver or receivers, shall prescribe the
    rules under which its representatives shall be selected and shall
    select the representatives of the carriers on the Adjustment Board
    and designate the division on which each such representative shall
    serve, but no carrier or system of carriers shall have more than
    one voting representative on any division of the Board.
      (c) Except as provided in the second paragraph of subsection (h)
    of this section, the national labor organizations, as defined in
    paragraph (a) of this section, acting each through the chief
    executive or other medium designated by the organization or
    association thereof, shall prescribe the rules under which the
    labor members of the Adjustment Board shall be selected and shall
    select such members and designate the division on which each member
    shall serve; but no labor organization shall have more than one
    voting representative on any division of the Board.
      (d) In case of a permanent or temporary vacancy on the Adjustment
    Board, the vacancy shall be filled by selection in the same manner
    as in the original selection.
      (e) If either the carriers or the labor organizations of the
    employees fail to select and designate representatives to the
    Adjustment Board, as provided in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this
    section, respectively, within sixty days after June 21, 1934, in
    case of any original appointment to office of a member of the
    Adjustment Board, or in case of a vacancy in any such office within
    thirty days after such vacancy occurs, the Mediation Board shall
    thereupon directly make the appointment and shall select an
    individual associated in interest with the carriers or the group of
    labor organizations of employees, whichever he is to represent.
      (f) In the event a dispute arises as to the right of any national
    labor organization to participate as per paragraph (c) of this
    section in the selection and designation of the labor members of
    the Adjustment Board, the Secretary of Labor shall investigate the
    claim of such labor organization to participate, and if such claim
    in the judgment of the Secretary of Labor has merit, the Secretary
    shall notify the Mediation Board accordingly, and within ten days
    after receipt of such advice the Mediation Board shall request
    those national labor organizations duly qualified as per paragraph
    (c) of this section to participate in the selection and designation
    of the labor members of the Adjustment Board to select a
    representative. Such representative, together with a representative
    likewise designated by the claimant, and a third or neutral party
    designated by the Mediation Board, constituting a board of three,
    shall within thirty days after the appointment of the neutral
    member, investigate the claims of the labor organization desiring
    participation and decide whether or not it was organized in
    accordance with sections 151a and 152 of this title and is
    otherwise properly qualified to participate in the selection of the
    labor members of the Adjustment Board, and the findings of such
    boards of three shall be final and binding.
      (g) Each member of the Adjustment Board shall be compensated by
    the party or parties he is to represent. Each third or neutral
    party selected under the provisions of paragraph (f) of this
    section shall receive from the Mediation Board such compensation as
    the Mediation Board may fix, together with his necessary traveling
    expenses and expenses actually incurred for subsistence, or per
    diem allowance in lieu thereof, subject to the provisions of law
    applicable thereto, while serving as such third or neutral party.
      (h) The said Adjustment Board shall be composed of four
    divisions, whose proceedings shall be independent of one another,
    and the said divisions as well as the number of their members shall
    be as follows:
      First division: To have jurisdiction over disputes involving
    train- and yard-service employees of carriers; that is, engineers,
    firemen, hostlers, and outside hostler helpers, conductors,
    trainmen, and yard-service employees. This division shall consist
    of eight members, four of whom shall be selected and designated by
    the carriers and four of whom shall be selected and designated by
    the labor organizations, national in scope and organized in
    accordance with sections 151a and 152 of this title and which
    represent employees in engine, train, yard, or hostling service:
    Provided, however, That each labor organization shall select and
    designate two members on the First Division and that no labor
    organization shall have more than one vote in any proceedings of
    the First Division or in the adoption of any award with respect to
    any dispute submitted to the First Division: Provided further,
    however, That the carrier members of the First Division shall cast
    no more than two votes in any proceedings of the division or in the
    adoption of any award with respect to any dispute submitted to the
    First Division.
      Second division: To have jurisdiction over disputes involving
    machinists, boilermakers, blacksmiths, sheet-metal workers,
    electrical workers, carmen, the helpers and apprentices of all the
    foregoing, coach cleaners, power-house employees, and railroad-shop
    laborers. This division shall consist of ten members, five of whom
    shall be selected by the carriers and five by the national labor
    organizations of the employees.
      Third division: To have jurisdiction over disputes involving
    station, tower, and telegraph employees, train dispatchers,
    maintenance-of-way men, clerical employees, freight handlers,
    express, station, and store employees, signal men, sleeping-car
    conductors, sleeping-car porters, and maids and dining-car
    employees. This division shall consist of ten members, five of whom
    shall be selected by the carriers and five by the national labor
    organizations of employees.
      Fourth division: To have jurisdiction over disputes involving
    employees of carriers directly or indirectly engaged in
    transportation of passengers or property by water, and all other
    employees of carriers over which jurisdiction is not given to the
    first, second, and third divisions. This division shall consist of
    six members, three of whom shall be selected by the carriers and
    three by the national labor organizations of the employees.
      (i) The disputes between an employee or group of employees and a
    carrier or carriers growing out of grievances or out of the
    interpretation or application of agreements concerning rates of
    pay, rules, or working conditions, including cases pending and
    unadjusted on June 21, 1934, shall be handled in the usual manner
    up to and including the chief operating officer of the carrier
    designated to handle such disputes; but, failing to reach an
    adjustment in this manner, the disputes may be referred by petition
    of the parties or by either party to the appropriate division of
    the Adjustment Board with a full statement of the facts and all
    supporting data bearing upon the disputes.
      (j) Parties may be heard either in person, by counsel, or by
    other representatives, as they may respectively elect, and the
    several divisions of the Adjustment Board shall give due notice of
    all hearings to the employee or employees and the carrier or
    carriers involved in any disputes submitted to them.
      (k) Any division of the Adjustment Board shall have authority to
    empower two or more of its members to conduct hearings and make
    findings upon disputes, when properly submitted, at any place
    designated by the division: Provided, however, That except as
    provided in paragraph (h) of this section, final awards as to any
    such dispute must be made by the entire division as hereinafter
    provided.
      (l) Upon failure of any division to agree upon an award because
    of a deadlock or inability to secure a majority vote of the
    division members, as provided in paragraph (n) of this section,
    then such division shall forthwith agree upon and select a neutral
    person, to be known as "referee", to sit with the division as a
    member thereof, and make an award. Should the division fail to
    agree upon and select a referee within ten days of the date of the
    deadlock or inability to secure a majority vote, then the division,
    or any member thereof, or the parties or either party to the
    dispute may certify that fact to the Mediation Board, which Board
    shall, within ten days from the date of receiving such certificate,
    select and name the referee to sit with the division as a member
    thereof and make an award. The Mediation Board shall be bound by
    the same provisions in the appointment of these neutral referees as
    are provided elsewhere in this chapter for the appointment of
    arbitrators and shall fix and pay the compensation of such
    referees.
      (m) The awards of the several divisions of the Adjustment Board
    shall be stated in writing. A copy of the awards shall be furnished
    to the respective parties to the controversy, and the awards shall
    be final and binding upon both parties to the dispute. In case a
    dispute arises involving an interpretation of the award, the
    division of the board upon request of either party shall interpret
    the award in the light of the dispute.
      (n) A majority vote of all members of the division of the
    Adjustment Board eligible to vote shall be competent to make an
    award with respect to any dispute submitted to it.
      (o) In case of an award by any division of the Adjustment Board
    in favor of petitioner, the division of the Board shall make an
    order, directed to the carrier, to make the award effective and, if
    the award includes a requirement for the payment of money, to pay
    to the employee the sum to which he is entitled under the award on
    or before a day named. In the event any division determines that an
    award favorable to the petitioner should not be made in any dispute
    referred to it, the division shall make an order to the petitioner
    stating such determination.
      (p) If a carrier does not comply with an order of a division of
    the Adjustment Board within the time limit in such order, the
    petitioner, or any person for whose benefit such order was made,
    may file in the District Court of the United States for the
    district in which he resides or in which is located the principal
    operating office of the carrier, or through which the carrier
    operates, a petition setting forth briefly the causes for which he
    claims relief, and the order of the division of the Adjustment
    Board in the premises. Such suit in the District Court of the
    United States shall proceed in all respects as other civil suits,
    except that on the trial of such suit the findings and order of the
    division of the Adjustment Board shall be conclusive on the
    parties, and except that the petitioner shall not be liable for
    costs in the district court nor for costs at any subsequent stage
    of the proceedings, unless they accrue upon his appeal, and such
    costs shall be paid out of the appropriation for the expenses of
    the courts of the United States. If the petitioner shall finally
    prevail he shall be allowed a reasonable attorney's fee, to be
    taxed and collected as a part of the costs of the suit. The
    district courts are empowered, under the rules of the court
    governing actions at law, to make such order and enter such
    judgment, by writ of mandamus or otherwise, as may be appropriate
    to enforce or set aside the order of the division of the Adjustment
    Board: Provided, however, That such order may not be set aside
    except for failure of the division to comply with the requirements
    of this chapter, for failure of the order to conform, or confine
    itself, to matters within the scope of the division's jurisdiction,
    or for fraud or corruption by a member of the division making the
    order.
      (q) If any employee or group of employees, or any carrier, is
    aggrieved by the failure of any division of the Adjustment Board to
    make an award in a dispute referred to it, or is aggrieved by any
    of the terms of an award or by the failure of the division to
    include certain terms in such award, then such employee or group of
    employees or carrier may file in any United States district court
    in which a petition under paragraph (p) could be filed, a petition
    for review of the division's order. A copy of the petition shall be
    forthwith transmitted by the clerk of the court to the Adjustment
    Board. The Adjustment Board shall file in the court the record of
    the proceedings on which it based its action. The court shall have
    jurisdiction to affirm the order of the division, or to set it
    aside, in whole or in part, or it may remand the proceedings to the
    division for such further action as it may direct. On such review,
    the findings and order of the division shall be conclusive on the
    parties, except that the order of the division may be set aside, in
    whole or in part, or remanded to the division, for failure of the
    division to comply with the requirements of this chapter, for
    failure of the order to conform, or confine itself, to matters
    within the scope of the division's jurisdiction, or for fraud or
    corruption by a member of the division making the order. The
    judgment of the court shall be subject to review as provided in
    sections 1291 and 1254 of title 28.
      (r) All actions at law based upon the provisions of this section
    shall be begun within two years from the time the cause of action
    accrues under the award of the division of the Adjustment Board,
    and not after.
      (s) The several divisions of the Adjustment Board shall maintain
    headquarters in Chicago, Illinois, meet regularly, and continue in
    session so long as there is pending before the division any matter
    within its jurisdiction which has been submitted for its
    consideration and which has not been disposed of.
      (t) Whenever practicable, the several divisions or subdivisions
    of the Adjustment Board shall be supplied with suitable quarters in
    any Federal building located at its place of meeting.
      (u) The Adjustment Board may, subject to the approval of the
    Mediation Board, employ and fix the compensations of such
    assistants as it deems necessary in carrying on its proceedings.
    The compensation of such employees shall be paid by the Mediation
    Board.
      (v) The Adjustment Board shall meet within forty days after June
    21, 1934, and adopt such rules as it deems necessary to control
    proceedings before the respective divisions and not in conflict
    with the provisions of this section. Immediately following the
    meeting of the entire Board and the adoption of such rules, the
    respective divisions shall meet and organize by the selection of a
    chairman, a vice chairman, and a secretary. Thereafter each
    division shall annually designate one of its members to act as
    chairman and one of its members to act as vice chairman: Provided,
    however, That the chairmanship and vice-chairmanship of any
    division shall alternate as between the groups, so that both the
    chairmanship and vice-chairmanship shall be held alternately by a
    representative of the carriers and a representative of the
    employees. In case of a vacancy, such vacancy shall be filled for
    the unexpired term by the selection of a successor from the same
    group.
      (w) Each division of the Adjustment Board shall annually prepare
    and submit a report of its activities to the Mediation Board, and
    the substance of such report shall be included in the annual report
    of the Mediation Board to the Congress of the United States. The
    reports of each division of the Adjustment Board and the annual
    report of the Mediation Board shall state in detail all cases
    heard, all actions taken, the names, salaries, and duties of all
    agencies, employees, and officers receiving compensation from the
    United States under the authority of this chapter, and an account
    of all moneys appropriated by Congress pursuant to the authority
    conferred by this chapter and disbursed by such agencies,
    employees, and officers.
      (x) Any division of the Adjustment Board shall have authority, in
    its discretion, to establish regional adjustment boards to act in
    its place and stead for such limited period as such division may
    determine to be necessary. Carrier members of such regional boards
    shall be designated in keeping with rules devised for this purpose
    by the carrier members of the Adjustment Board and the labor
    members shall be designated in keeping with rules devised for this
    purpose by the labor members of the Adjustment Board. Any such
    regional board shall, during the time for which it is appointed,
    have the same authority to conduct hearings, make findings upon
    disputes and adopt the same procedure as the division of the
    Adjustment Board appointing it, and its decisions shall be
    enforceable to the same extent and under the same processes. A
    neutral person, as referee, shall be appointed for service in
    connection with any such regional adjustment board in the same
    circumstances and manner as provided in paragraph (l) of this
    section, with respect to a division of the Adjustment Board.
    Second. System, group, or regional boards: establishment by
      voluntary agreement; special adjustment boards: establishment,
      composition, designation of representatives by Mediation Board,
      neutral member, compensation, quorum, finality and enforcement of
      awards
      Nothing in this section shall be construed to prevent any
    individual carrier, system, or group of carriers and any class or
    classes of its or their employees, all acting through their
    representatives, selected in accordance with the provisions of this
    chapter, from mutually agreeing to the establishment of system,
    group, or regional boards of adjustment for the purpose of
    adjusting and deciding disputes of the character specified in this
    section. In the event that either party to such a system, group, or
    regional board of adjustment is dissatisfied with such arrangement,
    it may upon ninety days' notice to the other party elect to come
    under the jurisdiction of the Adjustment Board.
      If written request is made upon any individual carrier by the
    representative of any craft or class of employees of such carrier
    for the establishment of a special board of adjustment to resolve
    disputes otherwise referable to the Adjustment Board, or any
    dispute which has been pending before the Adjustment Board for
    twelve months from the date the dispute (claim) is received by the
    Board, or if any carrier makes such a request upon any such
    representative, the carrier or the representative upon whom such
    request is made shall join in an agreement establishing such a
    board within thirty days from the date such request is made. The
    cases which may be considered by such board shall be defined in the
    agreement establishing it. Such board shall consist of one person
    designated by the carrier and one person designated by the
    representative of the employees. If such carrier or such
    representative fails to agree upon the establishment of such a
    board as provided herein, or to exercise its rights to designate a
    member of the board, the carrier or representative making the
    request for the establishment of the special board may request the
    Mediation Board to designate a member of the special board on
    behalf of the carrier or representative upon whom such request was
    made. Upon receipt of a request for such designation the Mediation
    Board shall promptly make such designation and shall select an
    individual associated in interest with the carrier or
    representative he is to represent, who, with the member appointed
    by the carrier or representative requesting the establishment of
    the special board, shall constitute the board. Each member of the
    board shall be compensated by the party he is to represent. The
    members of the board so designated shall determine all matters not
    previously agreed upon by the carrier and the representative of the
    employees with respect to the establishment and jurisdiction of the
    board. If they are unable to agree such matters shall be determined
    by a neutral member of the board selected or appointed and
    compensated in the same manner as is hereinafter provided with
    respect to situations where the members of the board are unable to
    agree upon an award. Such neutral member shall cease to be a member
    of the board when he has determined such matters. If with respect
    to any dispute or group of disputes the members of the board
    designated by the carrier and the representative are unable to
    agree upon an award disposing of the dispute or group of disputes
    they shall by mutual agreement select a neutral person to be a
    member of the board for the consideration and disposition of such
    dispute or group of disputes. In the event the members of the board
    designated by the parties are unable, within ten days after their
    failure to agree upon an award, to agree upon the selection of such
    neutral person, either member of the board may request the
    Mediation Board to appoint such neutral person and upon receipt of
    such request the Mediation Board shall promptly make such
    appointment. The neutral person so selected or appointed shall be
    compensated and reimbursed for expenses by the Mediation Board. Any
    two members of the board shall be competent to render an award.
    Such awards shall be final and binding upon both parties to the
    dispute and if in favor of the petitioner, shall direct the other
    party to comply therewith on or before the day named. Compliance
    with such awards shall be enforcible by proceedings in the United
    States district courts in the same manner and subject to the same
    provisions that apply to proceedings for enforcement of compliance
    with awards of the Adjustment Board.

-STATUTE-
    First. Board of Mediation abolished; National Mediation Board
      established; composition; term of office; qualifications;
      salaries; removal
      The Board of Mediation is abolished, effective thirty days from
    June 21, 1934, and the members, secretary, officers, assistants,
    employees, and agents thereof, in office upon June 21, 1934, shall
    continue to function and receive their salaries for a period of
    thirty days from such date in the same manner as though this
    chapter had not been passed. There is established, as an
    independent agency in the executive branch of the Government, a
    board to be known as the "National Mediation Board", to be composed
    of three members appointed by the President, by and with the advice
    and consent of the Senate, not more than two of whom shall be of
    the same political party. Each member of the Mediation Board in
    office on January 1, 1965, shall be deemed to have been appointed
    for a term of office which shall expire on July 1 of the year his
    term would have otherwise expired. The terms of office of all
    successors shall expire three years after the expiration of the
    terms for which their predecessors were appointed; but any member
    appointed to fill a vacancy occurring prior to the expiration of
    the term for which his predecessor was appointed shall be appointed
    only for the unexpired term of his predecessor. Vacancies in the
    Board shall not impair the powers nor affect the duties of the
    Board nor of the remaining members of the Board. Two of the members
    in office shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of the
    business of the Board. Each member of the Board shall receive
    necessary traveling and subsistence expenses, or per diem allowance
    in lieu thereof, subject to the provisions of law applicable
    thereto, while away from the principal office of the Board on
    business required by this chapter. No person in the employment of
    or who is pecuniarily or otherwise interested in any organization
    of employees or any carrier shall enter upon the duties of or
    continue to be a member of the Board. Upon the expiration of his
    term of office a member shall continue to serve until his successor
    is appointed and shall have qualified.
      All cases referred to the Board of Mediation and unsettled on
    June 21, 1934, shall be handled to conclusion by the Mediation
    Board.
      A member of the Board may be removed by the President for
    inefficiency, neglect of duty, malfeasance in office, or
    ineligibility, but for no other cause.
    Second. Chairman; principal office; delegation of powers; oaths;
      seal; report
      The Mediation Board shall annually designate a member to act as
    chairman. The Board shall maintain its principal office in the
    District of Columbia, but it may meet at any other place whenever
    it deems it necessary so to do. The Board may designate one or more
    of its members to exercise the functions of the Board in mediation
    proceedings. Each member of the Board shall have power to
    administer oaths and affirmations. The Board shall have a seal
    which shall be judicially noticed. The Board shall make an annual
    report to Congress.
    Third. Appointment of experts and other employees; salaries of
      employees; expenditures
      The Mediation Board may (1) subject to the provisions of the
    civil service laws, appoint such experts and assistants to act in a
    confidential capacity and such other officers and employees as are
    essential to the effective transaction of the work of the Board;
    (2) in accordance with chapter 51 and subchapter III of chapter 53
    of title 5, fix the salaries of such experts, assistants, officers,
    and employees; and (3) make such expenditures (including
    expenditures for rent and personal services at the seat of
    government and elsewhere, for law books, periodicals, and books of
    reference, and for printing and binding, and including expenditures
    for salaries and compensation, necessary traveling expenses and
    expenses actually incurred for subsistence, and other necessary
    expenses of the Mediation Board, Adjustment Board, Regional
    Adjustment Boards established under paragraph (w) of section 153 of
    this title, and boards of arbitration, in accordance with the
    provisions of this section and sections 153 and 157 of this title,
    respectively), as may be necessary for the execution of the
    functions vested in the Board, in the Adjustment Board and in the
    boards of arbitration, and as may be provided for by the Congress
    from time to time. All expenditures of the Board shall be allowed
    and paid on the presentation of itemized vouchers therefor approved
    by the chairman.
    Fourth. Delegation of powers and duties
      The Mediation Board is authorized by its order to assign, or
    refer, any portion of its work, business, or functions arising
    under this chapter or any other Act of Congress, or referred to it
    by Congress or either branch thereof, to an individual member of
    the Board or to an employee or employees of the Board to be
    designated by such order for action thereon, and by its order at
    any time to amend, modify, supplement, or rescind any such
    assignment or reference. All such orders shall take effect
    forthwith and remain in effect until otherwise ordered by the
    Board. In conformity with and subject to the order or orders of the
    Mediation Board in the premises, [and] such individual member of
    the Board or employee designated shall have power and authority to
    act as to any of said work, business, or functions so assigned or
    referred to him for action by the Board.
    Fifth. Transfer of officers and employees of Board of Mediation;
      transfer of appropriation
      All officers and employees of the Board of Mediation (except the
    members thereof, whose offices are abolished) whose services in the
    judgment of the Mediation Board are necessary to the efficient
    operation of the Board are transferred to the Board, without change
    in classification or compensation; except that the Board may
    provide for the adjustment of such classification or compensation
    to conform to the duties to which such officers and employees may
    be assigned.
      All unexpended appropriations for the operation of the Board of
    Mediation that are available at the time of the abolition of the
    Board of Mediation shall be transferred to the Mediation Board and
    shall be available for its use for salaries and other authorized
    expenditures.

    SUBCHAPTER I - GENERAL PROVISIONS

-HEAD-
    Sec. 155. Functions of Mediation Board

-STATUTE-
    First. Disputes within jurisdiction of Mediation Board
      The parties, or either party, to a dispute between an employee or
    group of employees and a carrier may invoke the services of the
    Mediation Board in any of the following cases:
      (a) A dispute concerning changes in rates of pay, rules, or
    working conditions not adjusted by the parties in conference.
      (b) Any other dispute not referable to the National Railroad
    Adjustment Board and not adjusted in conference between the parties
    or where conferences are refused.
      The Mediation Board may proffer its services in case any labor
    emergency is found by it to exist at any time.
      In either event the said Board shall promptly put itself in
    communication with the parties to such controversy, and shall use
    its best efforts, by mediation, to bring them to agreement. If such
    efforts to bring about an amicable settlement through mediation
    shall be unsuccessful, the said Board shall at once endeavor as its
    final required action (except as provided in paragraph third of
    this section and in section 160 of this title) to induce the
    parties to submit their controversy to arbitration, in accordance
    with the provisions of this chapter.
      If arbitration at the request of the Board shall be refused by
    one or both parties, the Board shall at once notify both parties in
    writing that its mediatory efforts have failed and for thirty days
    thereafter, unless in the intervening period the parties agree to
    arbitration, or an emergency board shall be created under section
    160 of this title, no change shall be made in the rates of pay,
    rules, or working conditions or established practices in effect
    prior to the time the dispute arose.
    Second. Interpretation of agreement
      In any case in which a controversy arises over the meaning or the
    application of any agreement reached through mediation under the
    provisions of this chapter, either party to the said agreement, or
    both, may apply to the Mediation Board for an interpretation of the
    meaning or application of such agreement. The said Board shall upon
    receipt of such request notify the parties to the controversy, and
    after a hearing of both sides give its interpretation within thirty
    days.
    Third. Duties of Board with respect to arbitration of disputes;
      arbitrators; acknowledgment of agreement; notice to arbitrators;
      reconvening of arbitrators; filing contracts with Board; custody
      of records and documents
      The Mediation Board shall have the following duties with respect
    to the arbitration of disputes under section 157 of this title:
      (a) On failure of the arbitrators named by the parties to agree
    on the remaining arbitrator or arbitrators within the time set by
    section 157 of this title, it shall be the duty of the Mediation
    Board to name such remaining arbitrator or arbitrators. It shall be
    the duty of the Board in naming such arbitrator or arbitrators to
    appoint only those whom the Board shall deem wholly disinterested
    in the controversy to be arbitrated and impartial and without bias
    as between the parties to such arbitration. Should, however, the
    Board name an arbitrator or arbitrators not so disinterested and
    impartial, then, upon proper investigation and presentation of the
    facts, the Board shall promptly remove such arbitrator.
      If an arbitrator named by the Mediation Board, in accordance with
    the provisions of this chapter, shall be removed by such Board as
    provided by this chapter, or if such an arbitrator refuses or is
    unable to serve, it shall be the duty of the Mediation Board,
    promptly, to select another arbitrator, in the same manner as
    provided in this chapter for an original appointment by the
    Mediation Board.
      (b) Any member of the Mediation Board is authorized to take the
    acknowledgement of an agreement to arbitrate under this chapter.
    When so acknowledged, or when acknowledged by the parties before a
    notary public or the clerk of a district court or a court of
    appeals of the United States, such agreement to arbitrate shall be
    delivered to a member of said Board or transmitted to said Board,
    to be filed in its office.
      (c) When an agreement to arbitrate has been filed with the
    Mediation Board, or with one of its members, as provided by this
    section, and when the said Board has been furnished the names of
    the arbitrators chosen by the parties to the controversy it shall
    be the duty of the Board to cause a notice in writing to be served
    upon said arbitrators, notifying them of their appointment,
    requesting them to meet promptly to name the remaining arbitrator
    or arbitrators necessary to complete the Board of Arbitration, and
    advising them of the period within which, as provided by the
    agreement to arbitrate, they are empowered to name such arbitrator
    or arbitrators.
      (d) Either party to an arbitration desiring the reconvening of a
    board of arbitration to pass upon any controversy arising over the
    meaning or application of an award may so notify the Mediation
    Board in writing, stating in such notice the question or questions
    to be submitted to such reconvened Board. The Mediation Board shall
    thereupon promptly communicate with the members of the Board of
    Arbitration, or a subcommittee of such Board appointed for such
    purpose pursuant to a provision in the agreement to arbitrate, and
    arrange for the reconvening of said Board of Arbitration or
    subcommittee, and shall notify the respective parties to the
    controversy of the time and place at which the Board, or the
    subcommittee, will meet for hearings upon the matters in
    controversy to be submitted to it. No evidence other than that
    contained in the record filed with the original award shall be
    received or considered by such reconvened Board or subcommittee,
    except such evidence as may be necessary to illustrate the
    interpretations suggested by the parties. If any member of the
    original Board is unable or unwilling to serve on such reconvened
    Board or subcommittee thereof, another arbitrator shall be named in
    the same manner and with the same powers and duties as such
    original arbitrator.
      (e) Within sixty days after June 21, 1934, every carrier shall
    file with the Mediation Board a copy of each contract with its
    employees in effect on the 1st day of April 1934, covering rates of
    pay, rules, and working conditions. If no contract with any craft
    or class of its employees has been entered into, the carrier shall
    file with the Mediation Board a statement of that fact, including
    also a statement of the rates of pay, rules, and working conditions
    applicable in dealing with such craft or class. When any new
    contract is executed or change is made in an existing contract with
    any class or craft of its employees covering rates of pay, rules,
    or working conditions, or in those rates of pay, rules, and working
    conditions of employees not covered by contract, the carrier shall
    file the same with the Mediation Board within thirty days after
    such new contract or change in existing contract has been executed
    or rates of pay, rules, and working conditions have been made
    effective.
      (f) The Mediation Board shall be the custodian of all papers and
    documents heretofore filed with or transferred to the Board of
    Mediation bearing upon the settlement, adjustment, or determination
    of disputes between carriers and their employees or upon mediation
    or arbitration proceedings held under or pursuant to the provisions
    of any Act of Congress in respect thereto; and the President is
    authorized to designate a custodian of the records and property of
    the Board of Mediation until the transfer and delivery of such
    records to the Mediation Board and to require the transfer and
    delivery to the Mediation Board of any and all such papers and
    documents filed with it or in its possession.

    representatives of the parties interested in such intended changes
    shall be agreed upon within ten days after the receipt of said
    notice, and said time shall be within the thirty days provided in
    the notice. In every case where such notice of intended change has
    been given, or conferences are being held with reference thereto,
    or the services of the Mediation Board have been requested by
    either party, or said Board has proffered its services, rates of
    pay, rules, or working conditions shall not be altered by the
    carrier until the controversy has been finally acted upon, as
    required by section 155 of this title, by the Mediation Board,
    unless a period of ten days has elapsed after termination of
    conferences without request for or proffer of the services of the

    SUBCHAPTER I - GENERAL PROVISIONS

-HEAD-
    Sec. 157. Arbitration

-STATUTE-
    First. Submission of controversy to arbitration
      Whenever a controversy shall arise between a carrier or carriers
    and its or their employees which is not settled either in
    conference between representatives of the parties or by the
    appropriate adjustment board or through mediation, in the manner
    provided in sections 151 - 156 of this title such controversy may,
    by agreement of the parties to such controversy, be submitted to
    the arbitration of a board of three (or, if the parties to the
    controversy so stipulate, of six) persons: Provided, however, That
    the failure or refusal of either party to submit a controversy to
    arbitration shall not be construed as a violation of any legal
    obligation imposed upon such party by the terms of this chapter or
    otherwise.
    Second. Manner of selecting board of arbitration
      Such board of arbitration shall be chosen in the following
    manner:
      (a) In the case of a board of three the carrier or carriers and
    the representatives of the employees, parties respectively to the
    agreement to arbitrate, shall each name one arbitrator; the two
    arbitrators thus chosen shall select a third arbitrator. If the
    arbitrators chosen by the parties shall fail to name the third
    arbitrator within five days after their first meeting, such third
    arbitrator shall be named by the Mediation Board.
      (b) In the case of a board of six the carrier or carriers and the
    representatives of the employees, parties respectively to the
    agreement to arbitrate, shall each name two arbitrators; the four
    arbitrators thus chosen shall, by a majority vote, select the
    remaining two arbitrators. If the arbitrators chosen by the parties
    shall fail to name the two arbitrators within fifteen days after
    their first meeting, the said two arbitrators, or as many of them
    as have not been named, shall be named by the Mediation Board.
    Third. Board of arbitration; organization; compensation; procedure
    (a) Notice of selection or failure to select arbitrators
      When the arbitrators selected by the respective parties have
    agreed upon the remaining arbitrator or arbitrators, they shall
    notify the Mediation Board; and, in the event of their failure to
    agree upon any or upon all of the necessary arbitrators within the
    period fixed by this chapter, they shall, at the expiration of such
    period, notify the Mediation Board of the arbitrators selected, if
    any, or of their failure to make or to complete such selection.
    (b) Organization of board; procedure
      The board of arbitration shall organize and select its own
    chairman and make all necessary rules for conducting its hearings:
    Provided, however, That the board of arbitration shall be bound to
    give the parties to the controversy a full and fair hearing, which
    shall include an opportunity to present evidence in support of
    their claims, and an opportunity to present their case in person,
    by counsel, or by other representative as they may respectively
    elect.
    (c) Duty to reconvene; questions considered
      Upon notice from the Mediation Board that the parties, or either
    party, to an arbitration desire the reconvening of the board of
    arbitration (or a subcommittee of such board of arbitration
    appointed for such purpose pursuant to the agreement to arbitrate)
    to pass upon any controversy over the meaning or application of
    their award, the board, or its subcommittee, shall at once
    reconvene. No question other than, or in addition to, the questions
    relating to the meaning or application of the award, submitted by
    the party or parties in writing, shall be considered by the
    reconvened board of arbitration or its subcommittee.
      Such rulings shall be acknowledged by such board or subcommittee
    thereof in the same manner, and filed in the same district court
    clerk's office, as the original award and become a part thereof.
    (d) Competency of arbitrators
      No arbitrator, except those chosen by the Mediation Board, shall
    be incompetent to act as an arbitrator because of his interest in
    the controversy to be arbitrated, or because of his connection with
    or partiality to either of the parties to the arbitration.
    (e) Compensation and expenses
      Each member of any board of arbitration created under the
    provisions of this chapter named by either party to the arbitration
    shall be compensated by the party naming him. Each arbitrator
    selected by the arbitrators or named by the Mediation Board shall
    receive from the Mediation Board such compensation as the Mediation
    Board may fix, together with his necessary traveling expenses and
    expenses actually incurred for subsistence, while serving as an
    arbitrator.
    (f) Award; disposition of original and copies
      The board of arbitration shall furnish a certified copy of its
    award to the respective parties to the controversy, and shall
    transmit the original, together with the papers and proceedings and
    a transcript of the evidence taken at the hearings, certified under
    the hands of at least a majority of the arbitrators, to the clerk
    of the district court of the United States for the district wherein
    the controversy arose or the arbitration is entered into, to be
    filed in said clerk's office as hereinafter provided. The said
    board shall also furnish a certified copy of its award, and the
    papers and proceedings, including testimony relating thereto, to
    the Mediation Board to be filed in its office; and in addition a
    certified copy of its award shall be filed in the office of the
    Interstate Commerce Commission: Provided, however, That such award
    shall not be construed to diminish or extinguish any of the powers
    or duties of the Interstate Commerce Commission, under subtitle IV
    of title 49.
    (g) Compensation of assistants to board of arbitration; expenses;
      quarters
      A board of arbitration may, subject to the approval of the
    Mediation Board, employ and fix the compensation of such assistants
    as it deems necessary in carrying on the arbitration proceedings.
    The compensation of such employees, together with their necessary
    traveling expenses and expenses actually incurred for subsistence,
    while so employed, and the necessary expenses of boards of
    arbitration, shall be paid by the Mediation Board.
      Whenever practicable, the board shall be supplied with suitable
    quarters in any Federal building located at its place of meeting or
    at any place where the board may conduct its proceedings or
    deliberations.
    (h) Testimony before board; oaths; attendance of witnesses;
      production of documents; subpoenas; fees
      All testimony before said board shall be given under oath or
    affirmation, and any member of the board shall have the power to
    administer oaths or affirmations. The board of arbitration, or any
    member thereof, shall have the power to require the attendance of
    witnesses and the production of such books, papers, contracts,
    agreements, and documents as may be deemed by the board of
    arbitration material to a just determination of the matters
    submitted to its arbitration, and may for that purpose request the
    clerk of the district court of the United States for the district
    wherein said arbitration is being conducted to issue the necessary
    subpoenas, and upon such request the said clerk or his duly
    authorized deputy shall be, and he is, authorized, and it shall be
    his duty, to issue such subpoenas.
      Any witness appearing before a board of arbitration shall receive
    the same fees and mileage as witnesses in courts of the United
    States, to be paid by the party securing the subpoena.

                            WORK RULES DISPUTE                        
      Pub. L. 88-108, Aug. 28, 1963, 77 Stat. 132, provided:
      "[Sec. 1. Settlement of disputes]. That no carrier which served
    the notices of November 2, 1959, and no labor organizations which
    received such notices or served the labor organization notices of
    September 7, 1960, shall make any change except by agreement, or
    pursuant to an arbitration award as hereinafter provided, in rates
    of pay, rules, or working conditions encompassed by any of such
    notices, or engage in any strike or lockout over any dispute
    arising from any of such notices. Any action heretofore taken which
    would be prohibited by the foregoing sentence shall be forthwith
    rescinded and the status existing immediately prior to such action
    restored.
      "Sec. 2. [Arbitration board]. There is hereby established an
    arbitration board to consist of seven members. The representatives
    of the carrier and organization parties to the aforesaid dispute
    are hereby directed, respectively, within five days after the
    enactment hereof [Aug. 28, 1963] each to name two persons to serve
    as members of such arbitration board. The four members thus chosen
    shall select three additional members. The seven members shall then
    elect a chairman. If the members chosen by the parties shall fail
    to name one or more of the additional three members within ten
    days, such additional members shall be named by the President. If
    either party fails to name a member or members to the arbitration
    board within the five days provided, the President shall name such
    member or members in lieu of such party and shall also name the
    additional three members necessary to constitute a board of seven
    members, all within ten days after the date of enactment of this
    joint resolution [Aug. 28, 1963]. Notwithstanding any other
    provision of law, the National Mediation Board is authorized and
    directed: (1) to compensate the arbitrators not named by the
    parties at a rate not in excess of $100 for each day together with
    necessary travel and subsistence expenses, and (2) to provide such
    services and facilities as may be necessary and appropriate in
    carrying out the purposes of this joint resolution.
      "Sec. 3. [Decision of board]. Promptly upon the completion of the
    naming of the arbitration board the Secretary of Labor shall
    furnish to the board and to the parties to the dispute copies of
    his statement to the parties of August 2, 1963, and the papers
    therewith submitted to the parties, together with memorandums and
    such other data as the board may request setting forth the matters
    with respect to which the parties were in tentative agreement and
    the extent of disagreement with respect to matters on which the
    parties were not in tentative agreement. The arbitration board
    shall make a decision, pursuant to the procedures hereinafter set
    forth, as to what disposition shall be made of those portions of
    the carriers' notices of November 2, 1959, identified as 'Use of
    Firemen (Helpers) on Other Than Steam Power' and 'Consist of Road
    and Yard Crews' and that portion of the organizations' notices of
    September 7, 1960, identified as 'Minimum Safe Crew Consist' and
    implementing proposals pertaining thereto. The arbitration board
    shall incorporate in such decision any matters on which it finds
    the parties were in agreement, shall resolve the matters on which
    the parties were not in agreement, and shall, in making its award,
    give due consideration to those matters on which the parties were
    in tentative agreement. Such award shall be binding on both the
    carrier and organization parties to the dispute and shall
    constitute a complete and final disposition of the aforesaid issues
    covered by the decision of the board of arbitration.
      "Sec. 4. [Award]. To the extent not inconsistent with this joint
    resolution the arbitration shall be conducted pursuant to sections
    7 and 8 of the Railway Labor Act [this section and section 158 of
    this title], the board's award shall be made and filed as provided
    in said sections and shall be subject to section 9 of said Act
    [section 159 of this title]. The United States District Court for
    the District of Columbia is hereby designated as the court in which
    the award is to be filed, and the arbitration board shall report to
    the National Mediation Board in the same manner as arbitration
    boards functioning pursuant to the Railway Labor Act [this
    chapter]. The award shall continue in force for such period as the
    arbitration board shall determine in its award, but not to exceed
    two years from the date the award takes effect, unless the parties
    agree otherwise.
      "Sec. 5. [Hearings]. The arbitration board shall begin its
    hearings thirty days after the enactment of this joint resolution
    [Aug. 28, 1963] or on such earlier date as the parties to the
    dispute and the board may agree upon and shall make and file its
    award not later than ninety days after the enactment of this joint
    resolution [Aug. 28, 1963]: Provided, however, That said award
    shall not become effective until sixty days after the filing of the
    award.
      "Sec. 6. [Collective bargaining for issues not arbitrated]. The
    parties to the disputes arising from the aforesaid notices shall
    immediately resume collective bargaining with respect to all issues
    raised in the notices of November 2, 1959, and September 7, 1960,
    not to be disposed of by arbitration under section 3 of this joint
    resolution and shall exert every reasonable effort to resolve such
    issues by agreement. The Secretary of Labor and the National
    Mediation Board are hereby directed to give all reasonable
    assistance to the parties and to engage in mediatory action
    directed toward promoting such agreement.
      "Sec. 7. [Considerations affecting award; enforcement.]
      "(a) In making any award under this joint resolution the
    arbitration board established under section 2 shall give due
    consideration to the effect of the proposed award upon adequate and
    safe transportation service to the public and upon the interests of
    the carrier and employees affected, giving due consideration to the
    narrowing of the areas of disagreement which has been accomplished
    in bargaining and mediation.
      "(b) The obligations imposed by this joint resolution, upon suit
    by the Attorney General, shall be enforcible through such orders as
    may be necessary by any court of the United States having
    jurisdiction of any of the parties.
      "Sec. 8. [Expiration date]. This joint resolution shall expire
    one hundred and eighty days after the date of its enactment [Aug.
    28, 1963], except that it shall remain in effect with respect to
    the last sentence of section 4 for the period prescribed in that
    sentence.
      "Sec. 9. [Separability]. If any provision of this joint
    resolution or the application thereof is held invalid, the
    remainder of this joint resolution and the application of such
    provision to other parties or in other circumstances not held
    invalid shall not be affected thereby."

-HEAD-
    Sec. 159. Award and judgment thereon; effect of chapter on
      individual employee

-STATUTE-
    First. Filing of award
      The award of a board of arbitration, having been acknowledged as
    herein provided, shall be filed in the clerk's office of the
    district court designated in the agreement to arbitrate.
    Second. Conclusiveness of award; judgment
      An award acknowledged and filed as herein provided shall be
    conclusive on the parties as to the merits and facts of the
    controversy submitted to arbitration, and unless, within ten days
    after the filing of the award, a petition to impeach the award, on
    the grounds hereinafter set forth, shall be filed in the clerk's
    office of the court in which the award has been filed, the court
    shall enter judgment on the award, which judgment shall be final
    and conclusive on the parties.
    Third. Impeachment of award; grounds
      Such petition for the impeachment or contesting of any award so
    filed shall be entertained by the court only on one or more of the
    following grounds:
      (a) That the award plainly does not conform to the substantive
    requirements laid down by this chapter for such awards, or that the
    proceedings were not substantially in conformity with this chapter;
      (b) That the award does not conform, nor confine itself, to the
    stipulations of the agreement to arbitrate; or
      (c) That a member of the board of arbitration rendering the award
    was guilty of fraud or corruption; or that a party to the
    arbitration practiced fraud or corruption which fraud or corruption
    affected the result of the arbitration: Provided, however, That no
    court shall entertain any such petition on the ground that an award
    is invalid for uncertainty; in such case the proper remedy shall be
    a submission of such award to a reconvened board, or subcommittee
    thereof, for interpretation, as provided by this chapter: Provided
    further, That an award contested as herein provided shall be
    construed liberally by the court, with a view to favoring its
    validity, and that no award shall be set aside for trivial
    irregularity or clerical error, going only to form and not to
    substance.
    Fourth. Effect of partial invalidity of award
      If the court shall determine that a part of the award is invalid
    on some ground or grounds designated in this section as a ground of
    invalidity, but shall determine that a part of the award is valid,
    the court shall set aside the entire award: Provided, however,
    That, if the parties shall agree thereto, and if such valid and
    invalid parts are separable, the court shall set aside the invalid
    part, and order judgment to stand as to the valid part.
    Fifth. Appeal; record
      At the expiration of 10 days from the decision of the district
    court upon the petition filed as aforesaid, final judgment shall be
    entered in accordance with said decision, unless during said 10
    days either party shall appeal therefrom to the court of appeals.
    In such case only such portion of the record shall be transmitted
    to the appellate court as is necessary to the proper understanding
    and consideration of the questions of law presented by said
    petition and to be decided.
    Sixth. Finality of decision of court of appeals
      The determination of said court of appeals upon said questions
    shall be final, and, being certified by the clerk thereof to said
    district court, judgment pursuant thereto shall thereupon be
    entered by said district court.
    Seventh. Judgment where petitioner's contentions are sustained
      If the petitioner's contentions are finally sustained, judgment
    shall be entered setting aside the award in whole or, if the
    parties so agree, in part; but in such case the parties may agree
    upon a judgment to be entered disposing of the subject matter of
    the controversy, which judgment when entered shall have the same
    force and effect as judgment entered upon an award.
    Eighth. Duty of employee to render service without consent; right
      to quit
      Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to require an
    individual employee to render labor or service without his consent,
    nor shall anything in this chapter be construed to make the
    quitting of his labor or service by an individual employee an
    illegal act; nor shall any court issue any process to compel the
    performance by an individual employee of such labor or service,
    without his consent.

    carrier providing rail commuter service (including the Amtrak
    Commuter Services Corporation) and its employees.

    (b) Request for establishment of emergency board
      If a dispute between the parties described in subsection (a) of
    this section is not adjusted under the foregoing provisions of this
    chapter and the President does not, under section 160 of this
    title, create an emergency board to investigate and report on such
    dispute, then any party to the dispute or the Governor of any State
    through which the service that is the subject of the dispute is
    operated may request the President to establish such an emergency
    board.
    (c) Establishment of emergency board
      (1) Upon the request of a party or a Governor under subsection
    (b) of this section, the President shall create an emergency board
    to investigate and report on the dispute in accordance with section
    160 of this title. For purposes of this subsection, the period
    during which no change, except by agreement, shall be made by the
    parties in the conditions out of which the dispute arose shall be
    120 days from the day of the creation of such emergency board.
      (2) If the President, in his discretion, creates a board to
    investigate and report on a dispute between the parties described
    in subsection (a) of this section, the provisions of this section
    shall apply to the same extent as if such board had been created
    pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subsection.
    (d) Public hearing by National Mediation Board upon failure of
      emergency board to effectuate settlement of dispute
      Within 60 days after the creation of an emergency board under

    the National Mediation Board shall conduct a public hearing on the
    dispute at which each party shall appear and provide testimony
    setting forth the reasons it has not accepted the recommendations
    of the emergency board for settlement of the dispute.
    (e) Establishment of second emergency board
      If no settlement in the dispute is reached at the end of the 120-
    day period beginning on the date of the creation of the emergency
    board, any party to the dispute or the Governor of any State
    through which the service that is the subject of the dispute is
    operated may request the President to establish another emergency
    board, in which case the President shall establish such emergency
    board.
    (f) Submission of final offers to second emergency board by parties
      Within 30 days after creation of a board under subsection (e) of
    this section, the parties to the dispute shall submit to the board
    final offers for settlement of the dispute.
    (g) Report of second emergency board
      Within 30 days after the submission of final offers under
    subsection (f) of this section, the emergency board shall submit a
    report to the President setting forth its selection of the most
    reasonable offer.
    (h) Maintenance of status quo during dispute period
      From the time a request to establish a board is made under
    subsection (e) of this section until 60 days after such board makes
    its report under subsection (g) of this section, no change, except
    by agreement, shall be made by the parties in the conditions out of
    which the dispute arose.
    (i) Work stoppages by employees subsequent to carrier offer
      selected; eligibility of employees for benefits
      If the emergency board selects the final offer submitted by the
    carrier and, after the expiration of the 60-day period described in
    subsection (h) of this section, the employees of such carrier
    engage in any work stoppage arising out of the dispute, such
    employees shall not be eligible during the period of such work
    stoppage for benefits under the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act
    [45 U.S.C. 351 et seq.].
    (j) Work stoppages by employees subsequent to employees offer
      selected; eligibility of employer for benefits
      If the emergency board selects the final offer submitted by the
    employees and, after the expiration of the 60-day period described
    in subsection (h) of this section, the carrier refuses to accept
    the final offer submitted by the employees and the employees of
    such carrier engage in any work stoppage arising out of the
    dispute, the carrier shall not participate in any benefits of any
    agreement between carriers which is designed to provide benefits to

-STATUTE-
      If a dispute between a carrier and its employees be not adjusted
    under the foregoing provisions of this chapter and should, in the
    judgment of the Mediation Board, threaten substantially to
    interrupt interstate commerce to a degree such as to deprive any
    section of the country of essential transportation service, the
    Mediation Board shall notify the President, who may thereupon, in
    his discretion, create a board to investigate and report respecting
    such dispute. Such board shall be composed of such number of
    persons as to the President may seem desirable: Provided, however,
    That no member appointed shall be pecuniarily or otherwise
    interested in any organization of employees or any carrier. The
    compensation of the members of any such board shall be fixed by the

-STATUTE-
      The disputes between an employee or group of employees and a

    interpretation or application of agreements concerning rates of
    pay, rules, or working conditions, including cases pending and
    unadjusted on April 10, 1936 before the National Labor Relations
    Board, shall be handled in the usual manner up to and including the
    chief operating officer of the carrier designated to handle such
    disputes; but, failing to reach an adjustment in this manner, the
    disputes may be referred by petition of the parties or by either
    party to an appropriate adjustment board, as hereinafter provided,
    with a full statement of the facts and supporting data bearing upon
    the disputes.
      It shall be the duty of every carrier and of its employees,
    acting through their representatives, selected in accordance with
    the provisions of this subchapter, to establish a board of
    adjustment of jurisdiction not exceeding the jurisdiction which may
    be lawfully exercised by system, group, or regional boards of
    adjustment, under the authority of section 153 of this title.
      Such boards of adjustment may be established by agreement between
    employees and carriers either on any individual carrier, or system,
    or group of carriers by air and any class or classes of its or
    their employees; or pending the establishment of a permanent
    National Board of Adjustment as hereinafter provided. Nothing in
    this chapter shall prevent said carriers by air, or any class or
    classes of their employees, both acting through their
    representatives selected in accordance with provisions of this
    subchapter, from mutually agreeing to the establishment of a
    National Board of Adjustment of temporary duration and of similarly
    limited jurisdiction.

-STATUTE-
      When, in the judgment of the National Mediation Board, it shall
    be necessary to have a permanent national board of adjustment in
    order to provide for the prompt and orderly settlement of disputes
    between said carriers by air, or any of them, and its or their
    employees, growing out of grievances or out of the interpretation
    or application of agreements between said carriers by air or any of
    them, and any class or classes of its or their employees, covering
    rates of pay, rules, or working conditions, the National Mediation
    Board is empowered and directed, by its order duly made, published,
    and served, to direct the said carriers by air and such labor
    organizations of their employees, national in scope, as have been
    or may be recognized in accordance with the provisions of this
    chapter, to select and designate four representatives who shall
    constitute a board which shall be known as the "National Air
    Transport Adjustment Board." Two members of said National Air
    Transport Adjustment Board shall be selected by said carriers by
    air and two members by the said labor organizations of the
    employees, within thirty days after the date of the order of the
    National Mediation Board, in the manner and by the procedure
    prescribed by section 153 of this title for the selection and
    designation of members of the National Railroad Adjustment Board.
    The National Air Transport Adjustment Board shall meet within forty
    days after the date of the order of the National Mediation Board
    directing the selection and designation of its members and shall
    organize and adopt rules for conducting its proceedings, in the
    manner prescribed in section 153 of this title. Vacancies in
    membership or office shall be filled, members shall be appointed in
    case of failure of the carriers or of labor organizations of the
    employees to select and designate representatives, members of the
    National Air Transport Adjustment Board shall be compensated,
    hearings shall be held, findings and awards made, stated, served,
    and enforced, and the number and compensation of any necessary
    assistants shall be determined and the compensation of such
    employees shall be paid, all in the same manner and to the same
    extent as provided with reference to the National Railroad
    Adjustment Board by section 153 of this title. The powers and
    duties prescribed and established by the provisions of section 153
    of this title with reference to the National Railroad Adjustment
    Board and the several divisions thereof are conferred upon and
    shall be exercised and performed in like manner and to the same
    extent by the said National Air Transport Adjustment Board, not
    exceeding, however, the jurisdiction conferred upon said National
    Air Transport Adjustment Board by the provisions of this
    subchapter. From and after the organization of the National Air
    Transport Adjustment Board, if any system, group, or regional board
    of adjustment established by any carrier or carriers by air and any
    class or classes of its or their employees is not satisfactory to
    either party thereto, the said party, upon ninety days' notice to
    the other party, may elect to come under the jurisdiction of the
    National Air Transport Adjustment Board.

      constituting the membership of such local lodge or division are
      employees of an employer conducting the principal part of its
      business in the United States; or (B) the headquarters of such
      local lodge or division is located in the United States; and
        (iii) an individual shall be deemed to be in the service of a
      general committee of a railway-labor-organization employer not
      conducting the principal part of its business in the United
      States only if (A) he is representing a local lodge or division
      described in clause (A) or (B) of paragraph (ii); or (B) all, or
      substantially all, the individuals represented by such general
      committee are employees of an employer conducting the principal
      part of its business in the United States; or (C) he acts in the
      capacity of a general chairman or an assistant general chairman
      of a general committee which represents individuals rendering
      service in the United States to an employer, but in such case if
      his office or headquarters is not located in the United States
      and the individuals represented by such general committee are
      employees of an employer not conducting the principal part of its
      business in the United States only such proportion of the
      remuneration for such service shall be regarded as compensation
      as the proportion which the mileage in the United States under
      the jurisdiction of such general committee bears to the total
      mileage under its jurisdiction, unless such mileage formula is
      inapplicable, in which case the Board may prescribe such other
      formula as it finds to be equitable, and if the application of
      such mileage formula, or such other formula as the Board may
      prescribe, would result in the compensation of the individual
      being less than 10 per centum of his remuneration for such
      service no part of such remuneration shall be regarded as
      compensation.

      (3) Notwithstanding the provisions of subdivisions (1) and (2) of
    this subsection, an individual not a citizen or resident of the
    United States shall not be deemed to be in the service of an
    employer when rendering service outside the United States to an
    employer who is required under the laws applicable in the place
    where the service is rendered to employ therein, in whole or in
    part, citizens or residents thereof. For purposes of this
    subdivision, the laws applicable on August 29, 1935, in the place
    where the service is rendered shall be deemed to have been
    applicable there at all times prior to that date.
      (e)(1) An individual shall be deemed to have been in the
    employment relation to an employer on August 29, 1935, if - 
        (i) he was on that date on leave of absence from his
      employment, expressly granted to him by the employer by whom he
      was employed, or by a duly authorized representative of such
      employer, and the grant of such leave of absence will have been
      established to the satisfaction of the Board before July 1947;
        (ii) he was in the service of an employer after August 29,
      1935, and before January 1946 in each of six calendar months,
      whether or not consecutive;
        (iii) before August 29, 1935, he did not retire and was not
      retired or discharged from the service of the last employer by
      whom he was employed or its corporate or operating successor, but
      (A) solely by reason of his physical or mental disability he
      ceased before August 29, 1935, to be in the service of such
      employer and thereafter remained continuously disabled until he
      attained age sixty-five or until August 1945, or (B) solely for
      such last stated reason an employer by whom he was employed
      before August 29, 1935, or an employer who is its successor did
      not on or after August 29, 1935, and before August 1945 call him
      to return to service, or (C) if he was so called he was solely
      for such reason unable to render service in six calendar months
      as provided in paragraph (ii); or
        (iv) he was on August 29, 1935, absent from the service of an
      employer by reason of a discharge which, within one year after
      the effective date thereof, was protested, to an appropriate
      labor representative or to the employer, as wrongful, and which
      was followed within ten years of the effective date thereof by
      his reinstatement in good faith to his former service with all
      his senority (!1) rights.


      (2) Notwithstanding the provisions of subdivision (1) of this
    subsection, an individual shall not be deemed to have been in the
    employment relation to an employer on August 29, 1935, if before
    that date he was granted a pension or gratuity on the basis of
    which a pension was awarded to him pursuant to section 6 of the
    Railroad Retirement Act of 1937 [45 U.S.C. 228f], or if during the
    last payroll period before August 29, 1935, in which he rendered
    service to an employer he was not in the service of an employer, in
    accordance with subsection (d) of this section, with respect to any
    service in such payroll period, or if he could have been in the
    employment relation to an employer only by reason of his having
    been, either before or after August 29, 1935, in the service of a
    local lodge or division defined as an employer in subsection (a) of
    this section.
      (f)(1) The term "years of service" shall mean the number of years
    an individual as an employee shall have rendered service to one or
    more employers for compensation or received remuneration for time
    lost, and shall be computed in accordance with the provisions of
    section 231b(i) of this title. Twelve calendar months, consecutive
    or otherwise, in each of which an employee has rendered such
    service or received such wages for time lost, shall constitute a
    year of service. Ultimate fractions shall be taken at their actual
    value.
      (2) Where service prior to August 29, 1935, may be included in
    the computation of years of service as provided in subdivision (3)
    of section 231b(i) of this title, it may be included as to - 
        (i) service rendered to a person which was an employer on
      August 29, 1935, irrespective of whether such person was an
      employer at the time such service was rendered;
        (ii) service rendered to any express company, sleeping-car
      company, or carrier by railroad which was a predecessor of a
      company which, on August 29, 1935, was an employer as defined in
      paragraph (i) of subsection (a)(1) of this section, irrespective
      of whether such predecessor was an employer at the time such
      service was rendered; and
        (iii) service rendered to a person not an employer in the
      performance of operations involving the use of standard railroad
      equipment if such operations were performed by an employer on
      August 29, 1935.

      (g)(1) For purposes of section 231b(i)(2) of this title, an
    individual shall be deemed to have been in "military service" when
    commissioned or enrolled in the active service of the land or naval
    forces of the United States and until resignation or discharge
    therefrom; and the service of any individual in any reserve
    component of the land or naval forces of the United States, while
    serving in the land or naval forces of the United States for any
    period, even though less than thirty days, shall be deemed to have
    been active service in such force during such period.
      (2) For purposes of section 231b(i)(2) of this title, a "war
    service period" shall mean (A) any war period, or (B) with respect
    to any particular individual, any period during which such
    individual (i) having been in military service at the end of a war
    period, was required to continue in military service, or (ii) was
    required by call of the President, or by any Act of Congress or
    regulation, order, or proclamation pursuant thereto, to enter and
    continue in military service, or (C) any period after September 7,
    1939, with respect to which a state of national emergency was duly
    declared to exist which requires a strengthening of the national
    defense. For purposes of section 231b(i)(2) of this title, the
    period beginning on June 15, 1948, and ending on December 15, 1950,
    shall be deemed to be a war service period with respect to any
    individual who without intervening employment not covered by this
    subchapter rendered service as an employee to an employer under
    this subchapter in the year such individual was released from
    active military service or in the year immediately following such
    year.
      (3) For purposes of section 231b(i)(2) of this title, a "war
    period" shall be deemed to have begun on whichever of the following
    dates is the earliest: (A) the date on which the Congress of the
    United States declared war; or (B) the date as of which the
    Congress of the United States declared that a state of war has
    existed; or (C) the date on which war was declared by one or more
    foreign states against the United States; or (D) the date on which
    any part of the United States or any territory under its
    jurisdiction was invaded or attacked by any armed force of one or
    more foreign states; or (E) the date on which the United States
    engaged in armed hostilities for the purpose of preserving the
    Union or of maintaining in any State of the Union a republican form
    of government.
      (4) For purposes of section 231b(i)(2) of this title, a "war
    period" shall be deemed to have ended on the date on which
    hostilities ceased.
      (h)(1) The term "compensation" means any form of money
    remuneration paid to an individual for services rendered as an
    employee to one or more employers or as an employee representative,
    including remuneration paid for time lost as an employee, but
    remuneration paid for time lost shall be deemed earned in the month
    in which such time is lost. A payment made by an employer to an
    individual through the employer's payroll shall be presumed, in the
    absence of evidence to the contrary, to be compensation for service
    rendered by such individual as an employee of the employer in the
    period with respect to which the payment is made. Compensation
    earned in any calendar month before 1947 shall be deemed paid in
    such month regardless of whether or when payment will have been in
    fact made, and compensation earned in any calendar year after 1946
    but paid after the end of such calendar year shall be deemed to be
    compensation paid in the calendar year in which it will have been
    earned if it is so reported by the employer before February 1 of
    the next succeeding calendar year or if the employee establishes,
    subject to the provisions of section 231h of this title, the period
    during which such compensation will have been earned.
      (2) An employee shall be deemed to be paid "for time lost" the
    amount he is paid by an employer with respect to an identifiable
    period of absence from the active service of the employer,
    including absence on account of personal injury, and the amount he
    is paid by the employer for loss of earnings resulting from his
    displacement to a less remunerative position or occupation. If a
    payment is made by an employer with respect to a personal injury
    and includes pay for time lost, the total payment shall be deemed
    to be paid for time lost unless, at the time of payment, a part of
    such payment is specifically apportioned to factors other than time
    lost, in which event only such part of the payment as is not so
    apportioned shall be deemed to be paid for time lost.
      (3) Solely for purposes of determining amounts to be included in
    the compensation of an employee, the term "compensation" shall also
    include cash tips received by an employee in any calendar month in
    the course of his employment by an employer unless the amount of
    such cash tips is less than $20.
      (4) Tips included as compensation by reason of the provisions of
    subdivision (3) shall be deemed to be paid at the time a written
    statement including such tips is furnished to the employer pursuant
    to section 6053(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 [26 U.S.C.
    6053(a)] or, if no statement including such tips is so furnished,
    at the time received. Tips so deemed to be paid in any month shall
    be deemed paid for services rendered in such month.
      (5) In determining compensation, there shall be attributable as
    compensation paid to an employee in calendar months in which he is
    in military service creditable under section 231b(i)(2) of this
    title, in addition to any other compensation paid to him with
    respect to such months - 
        (i) for each such calendar month prior to 1968, $160;
        (ii) for each such calendar month after 1967 and prior to 1975,
      $260; and
        (iii) for each such calendar month after 1974, the amount which
      is creditable as such individual's "wages" under section 209(d)
      of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 409(d)].

      (6) Notwithstanding the provisions of the preceding subdivisions
    of this subsection, the term "compensation" shall not include - 
        (i) tips, except as is provided under subdivision (3) of this
      subsection;
        (ii) remuneration for service which is performed by a non-
      resident alien individual for the period he is temporarily
      present in the United States as a nonimmigrant under subparagraph
      (F) or (J) of section 1101(a)(15) of title 8, as amended, and
      which is performed to carry out the purpose specified in
      subparagraph (F) or (J), as the case may be;
        (iii) remuneration earned in the service of a local lodge or
      division of a railway-labor-organization employer with respect to
      any calendar month in which the amount of such remuneration is
      less than $25;
        (iv) remuneration for service as a delegate to a national or
      international convention of a railway-labor-organization employer
      if the individual rendering such service has not previously
      rendered service, other than as such a delegate, which may be
      included in his "years of service;"
        (v) the amount of any payment (including any amount paid by an
      employer for insurance or annuities, or into a fund, to provide
      for any such payment) made to, or on behalf of, an employee or
      any of his dependents under a plan or system established by an
      employer which makes provision for his employees generally (or
      for his employees generally and their dependents) or for a class
      or classes of his employees (or for a class or classes of his
      employees and their dependents), on account of sickness or
      accident disability or medical or hospitalization expenses in
      connection with sickness or accident disability; and
        (vi) an amount paid specifically - either as an advance, as
      reimbursement or allowance - for traveling or other bona fide and
      necessary expenses incurred or reasonably expected to be incurred
      in the business of the employer provided any such payment is
      identified by the employer either by a separate payment or by
      specifically indicating the separate amounts where both wages and
      expense reimbursement or allowance are combined in a single
      payment.

      (7) The term "compensation" includes any separation allowance or
    subsistence allowance paid under any benefit schedule provided
    under section 701 of title VII of the Regional Rail Reorganization
    Act of 1973 [45 U.S.C. 797] (!2) and any termination allowance paid
    under section 702 of that Act [45 U.S.C. 797a], but does not
    include any other benefits payable under that title [45 U.S.C. 797
    et seq.]. The total amount of any subsistence allowance paid under
    a benefit schedule provided pursuant to section 701 of the Regional
    Rail Reorganization Act of 1973 shall be considered as having been
    earned in the month in which the employee first timely filed a
    claim for such an allowance.

      (8) Notwithstanding any other provision of this subchapter, for
    the purposes of sections 231b(a)(1), 231c(a)(1), and 231c(f)(1) of
    this title, the term "compensation" includes any payment from any
    source to an employee or employee representative if such payment is
    subject to tax under section 3201 or 3211 of the Internal Revenue
    Code of 1986 [26 U.S.C. 3201, 3211].
      (i) The term "Board" means the Railroad Retirement Board.
      (j) The term "company" includes corporations, associations, and
    joint-stock companies.
      (k) The term "employee" includes an officer of an employer.
      (l) The term "person" means an individual, a partnership, an
    association, a joint-stock company, a corporation, or the United
    States or any other governmental body.
      (m) The term "United States," when used in a geographical sense,
    means the States and the District of Columbia.
      (n) The term "Social Security Act" means the Social Security Act
    as amended [42 U.S.C. 301 et seq.] from time to time.
      (o) An individual shall be deemed to have "a current connection
    with the railroad industry" at the time an annuity begins to accrue
    to him and at death if, in any thirty consecutive calendar months
    before the month in which an annuity under this subchapter begins
    to accrue to him, or the month in which he dies if that first
    occurs, he will have been in service as an employee in not less
    than twelve calendar months and, if such thirty calendar months do
    not immediately precede such month, he will not have been engaged
    in any regular employment other than employment for an employer or
    employment with the Department of Transportation, the Interstate
    Commerce Commission, the Surface Transportation Board, the National
    Mediation Board, the National Transportation Safety Board, the
    State-owned railroad (as defined in the Alaska Railroad Transfer
    Act of 1982 [45 U.S.C. 1201 et seq.]), so long as it is an
    instrumentality of the State of Alaska, or the Railroad Retirement
    Board in the period before such month and after the end of such
    thirty months. For purposes of section 231a(b) of this title and
    section 231a(d) of this title only, an individual shall be deemed
    also to have "a current connection with the railroad industry" if,
    after having completed twenty-five years of service, such
    individual involuntarily and without fault ceased rendering service
    as an employee under this subchapter and did not thereafter decline
    an offer of employment in the same class or craft as the
    individual's most recent employee service. For purposes of section
    231a(d) of this title only, an individual shall be deemed to have a
    "current connection with the railroad industry" if a pension will
    have been payable to that individual under the Railroad Retirement
    Act of 1937 [45 U.S.C. 228a et seq.] or a retirement annuity based
    on service of not less than 10 years (as computed in awarding the
    annuity) will have begun to accrue to that individual prior to 1948
    under the Railroad Retirement Act of 1937. For the purposes of
    section 231a(d) of this title only, an individual shall be deemed
    also to have a "current connection with the railroad industry" if
    he will have completed ten years of service and (A) he would be
    neither fully nor currently insured under the Social Security Act
    [42 U.S.C. 301 et seq.] if his service as an employee after
    December 31, 1936, were included in the term "employment" as
    defined in that Act, or (B) he has no quarters of coverage under
    the Social Security Act.
      (p) The term "annuity" means a monthly sum which is payable on
    the first day of each calendar month for the accrual during the
    preceding calendar month.
      (q) The terms "quarter" and "calendar quarter" shall mean a
    period of three calendar months ending on March 31, June 30,
    September 30, or December 31.
      (r) For purposes of this subchapter, a person shall be considered
    to be permanently insured under the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C.
    301 et seq.] on December 31, 1974, if he or she would be fully
    insured within the meaning of section 214(a) of that Act [42 U.S.C.
    414(a)] when he or she attains age 62 solely on the basis of his or
    her quarters of coverage under that Act acquired prior to January
    1, 1975.

    2(d) of the Railroad Retirement Act of 1974 [section 231a(d) of
    this title] beginning January 1, 1975. For purposes of this section
    - 
        "(1) that portion of the survivor's annuity as is provided
      under section 4(f) of the Railroad Retirement Act of 1974
      [section 231c(f) of this title] shall initially be in an amount
      equal to the amount determined under clause (i) of section
      3(a)(6) of the Railroad Retirement Act of 1937 [section
      228c(a)(6) of this title] for the purpose of computing the last
      increase in the amount of such survivor's annuity as computed
      under the provisions of section 5(q) of the Railroad Retirement
      Act of 1937 [section 228e(q) of this title]: Provided, however,
      That the amount of such annuity shall be subject to reduction in
      accordance with the provisions of section 202(k) or 202(q) of the
      Social Security Act [section 402(k) or 402(q) of Title 42] in the
      same manner as any widow's insurance benefit, mother's insurance
      benefit, widower's insurance benefit, parent's insurance benefit,
      or child's insurance benefit payable under section 202 of the
      Social Security Act [section 402 of Title 42] and shall also be
      subject to reduction in accordance with the provisions of section
      4(i)(2) of the Railroad Retirement Act of 1974 [section
      231c(i)(2) of this title];
        "(2) that portion of the survivor's annuity as is provided
      under section 4(g) of the Railroad Retirement Act of 1974
      [section 231c(g) of this title] shall initially be in an amount
      equal to 30 per centum of the amount computed in accordance with
      the provisions of paragraph (1) of this section prior to any
      reductions, other than reductions on account of age, in
      accordance with the provisions of section 202(k) or 202(q) of the
      Social Security Act [section 402(k) or 402(q) of Title 42] and
      prior to any reductions in accordance with, the provisions of
      section 4(i)(2) of the Railroad Retirement Act of 1974 [section
      231c(i)(2) of this title]: Provided, however, That, if such
      survivor is not entitled to an annuity amount provided under
      paragraph (3) of this section, such amount shall not be less than
      an amount which would cause (A) the total of the annuity amounts
      provided the survivor by the provisions of this section for the
      month of January 1975 to equal (B) the amount of the annuity
      which the survivor would have received for such month under
      section 5 of the Railroad Retirement Act of 1937 [section 228e of
      this title] (without regard to section 5(i) of that Act [section
      228e(i) of this title]) if this Act [enacting this subchapter]
      had not been enacted; and
        "(3) if the survivor is a widow or widower who was entitled to
      an old-age insurance benefit or a disability insurance benefit
      under the Social Security Act [section 301 et seq. of Title 42]
      on December 31, 1974, or was fully insured under that Act on that
      date, the annuity amounts provided under paragraphs (1) and (2)
      of this section shall be increased by an amount determined under
      the provisions of 4(h)(1) of the Railroad Retirement Act of 1974
      [section 231c(h)(1) of this title]: Provided, however, That, if
      the widow or widower was entitled to a monthly insurance benefit
      under the Social Security Act on December 31, 1974, such amount
      shall not be less nor more than an amount which would cause (A)
      the total of (i) the annuity amounts provided the widow or
      widower by the provisions of this section for the month of
      January 1975 plus (ii) the monthly insurance benefit to which
      such widow or widower is entitled for that month under the Social
      Security Act (before any deductions on account of work) to equal
      (B) the total of (i) the widow's or widower's annuity under the
      Railroad Retirement Act of 1937 [subchapter III of this chapter]
      (without regard to section 5(i) of that Act [section 228e(i) of
      this title]) plus (ii) the monthly insurance benefit under the
      Social Security Act (before any deductions on account of work)
      which such widow or widower would have received for such month if
      this Act [enacting this subchapter] had not been enacted.
      "Sec. 208. For purposes of paragraph (1) of section 204(a),
    paragraph (1) of section 206, and paragraph (1) of section 207, the
    fact that the amount of the annuity payable to an individual,
    spouse, or survivor under the Railroad Retirement Act of 1937
    [subchapter III of this chapter] for the month of December 1974 may
    not (i) in the case of an individual have been computed under the
    provisions of section 3(a) of such Act [section 228c(a) of this
    title] or that part of section 3(e) of such Act [section 228c(e) of
    this title] which precedes the first proviso; (ii) in the case of a
    spouse, have been computed under the provisions of section 2 of
    such Act [section 228b of this title], or (iii) in the case of a
    survivor, have been computed under the provisions of section 5 of
    such Act [section 228e of this title], shall be disregarded, and
    the amount determined under clause (i) of section 3(a)(6) of such
    Act [section 228c(a)(6) of this title] with respect to such
    individual, spouse, or survivor shall, for purposes of such
    paragraphs, be the amount which would have been determined under
    such clause (i) if the annuity of such individual had been computed
    under the provisions of section 3(a) [section 228c(a) of this
    title], and that part of section 3(e) [section 228c(e) of this
    title] which preceded the first proviso, of such Act; the annuity
    of such spouse had been computed under the provisions of section 2
    of such Act [section 228b of this title]; or the annuity of such
    survivor had been computed under the provisions of section 5 of
    such Act [section 228e of this title].
      "Sec. 209. (a) Whenever monthly insurance benefits under section
    202 of the Social Security Act [section 402 of Title 42] are
    increased, the amount of each annuity provided by section 202(a),
    section 203(a), paragraph (1) of section 204(a), paragraph (1) of
    section 206, and paragraphs (1) and (2) of section 207 shall be
    increased in the same manner, and effective the same date as other
    annuities of the same type payable under section 2 of the Railroad
    Retirement Act of 1974 [section 231a of this title] are increased.

-STATUTE-
    (a) Individuals eligible for annuities; disability standards; proof
      of continued disability
      (1) The following-described individuals, if they shall have
    completed ten years of service (or, for purposes of paragraphs (i),
    (iii), and (v), five years of service, all of which accrues after
    December 31, 1995) and shall have filed application for annuities,
    shall, subject to the conditions set forth in subsections (e), (f),
    and (h) of this section, be entitled to annuities in the amounts
    provided under section 231b of this title - 
        (i) individuals who have attained retirement age (as defined in
      section 216(l) of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 416(l)]);
        (ii) individuals who have attained the age of sixty and have
      completed thirty years of service;
        (iii) individuals who have attained the age of sixty-two and
      have completed less than thirty years of service, but the annuity
      of such individuals shall be reduced by  1/180  for each of the
      first 36 months that he or she is under retirement age (as
      defined in section 216(l) of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C.
      416(l)]) when the annuity begins to accrue and by  1/240  for
      each additional month that he or she is under retirement age (as
      defined in section 216(l) of the Social Security Act) when the
      annuity begins to accrue;
        (iv) individuals who have a current connection with the
      railroad industry, whose permanent physical or mental condition
      is such as to be disabling for work in their regular occupation,
      and who (A) have completed twenty years of service or (B) have
      attained the age of sixty; and
        (v) individuals whose permanent physical or mental condition is
      such that they are unable to engage in any regular employment.

      (2) For the purposes of paragraph (iv) of subdivision (1), the
    Board, with the cooperation of employers and employees, shall
    secure the establishment of standards determining the physical and
    mental conditions which permanently disqualify employees for work
    in the several occupations in the railroad industry, and the Board,
    employers, and employees shall cooperate in the promotion of the
    greatest practicable degree of uniformity in the standards applied
    by the several employers. An individual's condition shall be deemed
    to be disabling for work in his regular occupation if he will have
    been disqualified by his employer for service in his regular
    occupation in accordance with the applicable standards so
    established; if the employee will not have been so disqualified by
    his employer, the Board shall determine whether his condition is
    disabling for work in his regular occupation in accordance with the
    standards generally established; and, if the employee's regular
    occupation is not one with respect to which standards will have
    been established, the standards relating to a reasonably comparable
    occupation shall be used. If there is no such comparable
    occupation, the Board shall determine whether the employee's
    condition is disabling for work in his regular occupation by
    determining whether under the practices generally prevailing in
    industries in which such occupation exists such condition is a
    permanent disqualification for work in such occupation. For
    purposes of this subdivision and paragraph (iv) of subdivision (1),
    an employee's "regular occupation" shall be deemed to be the
    occupation in which he will have been engaged in more calendar
    months than the calendar months in which he will have been engaged
    in any other occupation during the last preceding five calendar
    years, whether or not consecutive, in each of which years he will
    have earned wages or salary, except that, if an employee
    establishes that during the last fifteen consecutive calendar years
    he will have been engaged in another occupation in one-half or more
    of all the months in which he will have earned wages or salary, he
    may claim such other occupation as his regular occupation.
      (3) Such satisfactory proof shall be made from time to time as
    prescribed by the Board, of the disability provided for in
    paragraph (iv) or (v) of subdivision (1) and of the continuance of
    such disability (according to the standards applied in the
    establishment of such disability) until the employee attains
    retirement age (as defined in section 216(l) of the Social Security
    Act [42 U.S.C. 416(l)]). If the individual fails to comply with the
    requirements prescribed by the Board as to proof of the continuance
    of the disability until he attains retirement age (as defined in
    section 216(l) of the Social Security Act), his right to an annuity
    by reason of such disability shall, except for good cause shown to
    the Board, cease, but without prejudice to his rights to any
    subsequent annuity to which he may be entitled.
      (4) An individual who is entitled to an annuity under paragraph
    (v) of subdivision (1), but who does not have at least ten years of
    service, shall, prior to the month in which the individual attains
    age 62, be entitled only to an annuity amount computed under
    section 231b(a) of this title (without regard to section 231b(a)(2)
    of this title) or section 231b(f)(3) of this title. Upon attainment
    of age 62, such an individual may also be entitled to an annuity
    amount computed under section 231b(b) of this title, but such
    annuity amount shall be reduced for early retirement in the same
    manner as if the individual were entitled to an annuity under
    subsection (a)(1)(iii) of this section.
    (b) Individuals eligible for supplemental annuities
      An individual who - 
        (i) has attained age 60 and completed thirty years of service
      or attained age 65;
        (ii) has completed twenty-five years of service;
        (iii) is entitled to the payment of an annuity under subsection
      (a)(1) of this section;
        (iv) had a current connection with the railroad industry at the
      time such annuity began to accrue; and
        (v) has performed compensated service in at least one month
      prior to October 1, 1981;

    shall, subject to the conditions set forth in subsections (e) and
    (h) of this section, be entitled to a supplemental annuity in the
    amount provided under section 231b of this title: Provided,
    however, That in cases where an individual's annuity under
    subsection (a)(1) of this section begins to accrue on other than
    the first day of the month, the amount of any supplemental annuity
    to which he is entitled for that month shall be reduced by one-
    thirtieth for each day with respect to which he is not entitled to
    an annuity under subsection (a)(1) of this section.
    (c) Spouses eligible for annuities
      (1) The spouse of an individual, if - 
        (i) such individual (A) is entitled to an annuity under
      subsection (a)(1) of this section and (B) has attained the age of
      60 and has completed thirty years of service or has attained the
      age of 62, and
        (ii) such spouse (A) has attained retirement age (as defined in
      section 216(l) of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 416(l)]), or
      (B) has attained the age of 60 and such individual has completed
      thirty years of service, or (C), in the case of a wife, has in
      her care (individually or jointly with her husband) a child who
      meets the qualifications prescribed in paragraph (iii) of
      subsection (d)(1) of this section (without regard to the
      provisions of clause (B) of such paragraph),

    shall, subject to the conditions set forth in subsections (e), (f),
    and (h) of this section, be entitled to a spouse's annuity, if he
    or she has filed application therefor, in the amount provided under
    section 231c of this title.
      (2) A spouse who would be entitled to an annuity under
    subdivision (1) or a divorced wife who would be entitled to an
    annuity under subdivision (4) if he or she had attained retirement
    age (as defined in section 216(l) of the Social Security Act [42
    U.S.C. 416(l)]) may elect upon or after attaining the age of 62 to
    receive such annuity, but the annuity in any such case shall be
    reduced by  1/144  for each of the first 36 months that the spouse
    or divorced wife is under retirement age (as defined in section
    216(l) of the Social Security Act) when the annuity begins to
    accrue and by  1/240  for each additional month that the spouse or
    divorced wife is under retirement age (as defined in section 216(l)
    of the Social Security Act) when the annuity begins to accrue,
    except that the annuity of a divorced wife who was previously
    entitled to a spouse annuity which was reduced under this
    subdivision shall be reduced by the same percentage as was
    applicable to the spouse annuity.
      (3) For the purposes of this subchapter, the term "spouse" shall
    mean the wife or husband of an annuitant under subsection (a)(1) of
    this section who (i) was married to such annuitant for a period of
    not less than one year immediately preceding the day on which the
    application for a spouse's annuity is filed, or in the month prior
    to his or her marriage to such annuitant was eligible for an
    annuity under paragraph (i) or (iv) of subsection (d)(1) of this
    section or, on the basis of disability, under paragraph (iii)
    thereof, or is the parent of such annuitant's son or daughter; and
    (ii) in the case of a husband, was receiving at least one-half of
    his support from his wife at the time his wife's annuity under
    subsection (a)(1) of this section began.
      (4) The "divorced wife" (as defined in section 216(d) of the
    Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 416(d)]) of an individual, if -

        (ii) such divorced wife (A) has attained retirement age (as
      defined in section 216(l) of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C.
      416(l)] (!1) and (B) is not married; and

        (iii) such divorced wife would have been entitled to a benefit
      under section 202(b) of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C.
      402(b)] as the divorced wife of such individual if all of such
      individual's service as an employee after December 31, 1936, had
      been included in the term "employment" as defined in that Act [42
      U.S.C. 301 et seq.];

      section 202(f) of that Act shall include an individual entitled
      to an annuity under paragraph (i) and an individual entitled to
      an annuity under paragraph (ii), and the reference in section
      202(e)(3) (!4) and section 202(g)(3) of the Social Security Act
      to an individual entitled under section 202(d) or section 202(h)
      of that Act shall include an individual entitled to an annuity
      under paragraph (iii) or paragraph (iv), and the references in
      section 202(g)(3) of the Social Security Act to an individual
      entitled under section 202(a) or section 223(a) of that Act [42
      U.S.C. 402(a), 423(a)] shall include an individual entitled to an
      annuity under subsection (a)(1) of this section.



      (2) The period referred to in clause (B) of subdivision (1)(i) is
    the period (i) beginning with the latest of (A) the month of the
    employee's death, (B) in the case of a widow, the last month for
    which she was entitled to an annuity under paragraph (ii) of
    subdivision (1) as the widow of the deceased employee, or (C) the
    month in which the widow's or widower's previous entitlement to an
    annuity as the widow or widower of the deceased employee terminated
    because her or his disability had ceased and (ii) ending with the
    month before the month in which she or he attains age sixty, or, if
    earlier, with the close of the eighty-fourth month following the
    month with which such period began.
      (3) For purposes of paragraph (i) or (iii) of subdivision (1), a
    widow, widower, or child shall be under a disability if her or his
    permanent physical or mental condition is such that she or he is
    unable to engage in any regular employment. The provisions of
    subsection (a)(3) of this section as to the proof of disability
    shall apply with regard to determinations with respect to
    disability under subdivision (1).
      (4) In determining for purposes of this subsection and
    subdivision (3) of subsection (c) of this section whether an
    applicant is the wife, husband, widow, widower, child, or parent of
    a deceased employee as claimed, the rules set forth in section
    216(h) of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 416(h)] shall be
    applied deeming, for this purpose, individuals entitled to an
    annuity under subsection (c) of this section to be entitled to
    benefits under subsection (b) or (c) of section 202 of the Social
    Security Act [42 U.S.C. 402] and individuals entitled to an annuity
    under paragraph (i) or (ii) of subsection (d)(1) of this section to
    be entitled to a benefit under subsection (e), (f), or (g) of
    section 202 of the Social Security Act. For purposes of paragraph
    (iii) of subdivision (1), a child shall be deemed to have been
    dependent upon his parent employee if the conditions set forth in
    section 202(d)(3), (4), or (9) of the Social Security Act are
    fulfilled. The provisions of paragraph (7) of section 202(d) of the
    Social Security Act (defining the terms "full-time elementary or
    secondary school student" and "elementary or secondary school")
    shall be applied by the Board in the administration of this
    subsection as if the references therein to the Secretary were
    references to the Board. A child who attains age nineteen at a time
    when he is a full-time elementary or secondary school student (as
    defined in subparagraph (A) of paragraph (7) of section 202(d) of
    the Social Security Act and without the application of subparagraph
    (B) of such paragraph) but has not (at such time) completed the
    requirements for, or received, a diploma or equivalent certificate
    from a secondary school (as defined in section 202(d)(7)(c)(i) (!5)
    of the Social Security Act) shall be deemed (for purposes of
    determining his continuing or initial entitlement to an annuity
    under this subsection) not to have attained such age until the
    first day of the first month following the end of the quarter or
    semester in which he is enrolled at such time (or, if the
    elementary or secondary school in which he is enrolled is not
    operated on a quarter or semester system, until the first day of
    the first month following the completion of the course in which he
    is enrolled or until the first day of the third month beginning
    after such time, whichever first occurs).

    (e) Compensated service; rights to return
      (1) No individual shall be entitled to an annuity under
    subsection (a)(1) of this section until he shall have ceased to
    render compensated service to an employer as defined in section
    231(a) of this title.
      (2) An annuity under subsection (a)(1) of this section shall be
    paid only if the applicant shall have relinquished such rights as
    he may have to return to the service of an employer: Provided,
    however, That this requirement shall not apply to individuals
    mentioned in paragraphs (iv) and (v) of subsection (a)(1) of this
    section prior to attaining retirement age (as defined in section
    216(l) of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 416(l)]): Provided
    further, That, notwithstanding the provisions of the preceding
    proviso and of clause (i) of subsection (c)(1) of this section, an
    annuity shall be paid to the spouse of an individual only if such
    individual shall have satisfied the requirements of this
    subdivision without regard to the preceding proviso: And provided
    further, That, notwithstanding the provisions of the first proviso
    of this subdivision and of clause (iii) of subsection (b)(1) of
    this section, a supplemental annuity shall be paid to an individual
    only if such individual shall have satisfied the requirements of
    this subdivision without regard to the first proviso thereof.
      (3) No annuity under subsection (a)(1) of this section or
    supplemental annuity under subsection (b)(1) of this section shall
    be paid with respect to any month in which an individual in receipt
    of an annuity or supplemental annuity thereunder shall render
    compensated service to an employer. Individuals receiving annuities
    under subsection (a)(1) of this section shall report to the Board
    immediately all such compensated service.
      (4) No annuity under paragraph (iv) or (v) of subsection (a)(1)
    of this section shall be paid to an individual with respect to any
    month in which the individual is under retirement age (as defined
    in section 216(l) of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 416(l)])
    and is paid more than the monthly allowable earnings as defined in
    the section (after deduction of disability related work expenses)
    from employment or self-employment of any form: Provided, however,
    That for purposes of this subdivision, if a payment in any one
    calendar month is for accruals in more than one calendar month,
    such payment shall be deemed to have been paid in each of the
    months in which accrued to the extent accrued in such month. Any
    such individual under the retirement age (as defined in section
    216(l) of the Social Security Act) shall report to the Board any
    such payment of earnings for such employment or self-employment
    before receipt and acceptance of an annuity for the second month
    following the month of such payment. A deduction shall be imposed,
    with respect to any such individual who fails to make such report,
    in the annuity or annuities otherwise due the individual, in an
    amount equal to the amount of the annuity for each month in which
    he is paid such earnings in such employment or self-employment,
    except that the first deduction imposed pursuant to this sentence
    shall in no case exceed an amount equal to the amount of the
    annuity otherwise due for the first month with respect to which the
    deduction is imposed. If pursuant to the first sentence of this
    subdivision an annuity was not paid to an individual with respect
    to one or more months in any calendar year, and it is subsequently
    established that the total amount of such individual's earnings
    during such year as determined in accordance with that sentence
    (but exclusive of earnings for services described in subdivision
    (3)) did not exceed the amount of earnings computed by totaling the
    monthly allowable earnings as determined under this section for
    each month in the year (after deduction of disability related work
    expenses), the annuity with respect to such month or months, and
    any deduction imposed by reason of the failure to report earnings
    for such month or months under the third sentence of this
    subdivision, shall then be payable. If the total amount of such
    individual's earnings during such year (exclusive of earnings for
    services as described in subdivision (3) and after deduction of
    disability related work expenses) is in excess of the annual
    allowable earnings amount, the number of months in such year with
    respect to which an annuity is not payable by reason of the first
    and third sentences shall not exceed the number of months derived
    by dividing the amount by which such annual earnings exceed the
    annual allowable earnings amount by the monthly allowable earning
    amount determined under this section. If the computation under the
    preceding sentence results in a remainder greater than or equal to
    one-half, the number of months for which an annuity is not payable
    as determined under the preceding sentence shall be increased by
    one. The annual allowable earnings amount shall be computed by
    totaling the amount of monthly allowable earnings as determined
    under the first sentence of this subdivision for each month in the
    calender (!6) year. If the amount of the individual's annuity has
    changed during the calendar year, any payment of annuities which
    become payable solely by reason of the limitations in the preceding
    three sentences shall be made first with respect to the month or
    months for which the annuity is larger. For purposes of this
    subdivision, "the monthly allowable earnings" shall be $700, except
    that for each year after 2007, "the monthly allowable earnings"
    amount shall be the larger of the amount for the previous year or
    the amount calculated by multiplying $700 by the ratio of the
    national average wage index for the year 2 calender (!6) years
    before the year for which the amount is being calculated to the
    national average wage index for the year 2005. The amount so
    computed will be rounded to the next higher multiple of $10 where
    such amount is a multiple of $5 but not of $10 and to the nearest
    multiple of $10 in any other case.

      (5) The annuity of a spouse or divorced wife under subsection (c)
    of this section shall, with respect to any month, be subject to the
    same provisions of this subsection as the individual's annuity. In
    addition, the annuity of a spouse under subsection (c) of this
    section shall not be payable for any month if the individual's
    annuity under subsection (a)(1) of this section is not payable for
    such month by reason of the provisions of this subsection.
    (f) Deductions on account of work
      (1) That portion of the individual's annuity as is computed under
    section 231b(a) of this title on the basis of (A) his compensation
    and years of service subsequent to December 31, 1974, and (B) his
    wages and self-employment income derived from employment and self-
    employment under the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 301 et seq.]
    and that portion of the individual's annuity as is computed under
    section 231b(h) of this title shall be subject to deductions on
    account of work pursuant to the provisions of section 203 of the
    Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 403] in the same manner as if such
    portion of such annuity were a monthly insurance benefit under that
    Act: Provided, however, That the provisions of this subdivision
    shall be applicable to the annuity of an individual only if such
    individual would be fully insured under the Social Security Act on
    the basis of wages and self-employment income derived from
    employment and self-employment under that Act and on the basis of
    compensation derived from service as an employee after December 31,
    1974, if such service as an employee had been included in the term
    "employment" as defined in that Act. Any person in receipt of an
    annuity subject to deduction under this subsection shall report to
    the Board the receipt of excess earnings as defined in paragraph
    (3) of section 203(f) of the Social Security Act.
      (2) That portion of the spouse's or divorced wife's annuity under
    subsection (c) of this section which is derived from the portion of
    the individual's annuity subject to deductions under subdivision
    (1) and that portion of the spouse's or divorced wife's annuity as
    is computed under section 231c(e) of this title shall be subject to
    deductions on account of work pursuant to the provisions of section
    203 of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.S. 403] in the same manner
    as if such portion of such spouse's or divorced wife's annuity were
    a monthly insurance benefit under that Act. In addition, such
    portion of the spouse's or divorced wife's annuity shall be subject
    to deductions if the individual's annuity is subject to deductions
    under subdivision (1) in the same manner as if such portion of such
    spouse's or divorced wife's annuity were a monthly insurance
    benefit under the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 301 et seq.].
      (3) Deductions shall not be made pursuant to subdivision (1) from
    that portion of an individual's annuity as is computed under
    section 231b(a) of this title for any month in which the annuity of
    such individual is reduced pursuant to section 231b(m) of this
    title. This subdivision shall be disregarded in determining the
    applicability and amount of deductions in a spouse's annuity
    pursuant to subdivision (2) of this subsection.
      (4) Deductions shall not be made pursuant to subdivision (2) from
    that portion of a spouse's annuity as is computed under section
    231c(a) of this title for any month in which the annuity of such
    spouse is reduced due to entitlement to a benefit under title II of
    the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 401 et seq.].
      (5) If an annuity begins to accrue on other than the first day of
    a month, subdivisions (1) and (2) of this subsection shall not
    apply in the year the annuity begins to accrue if the annuitant has
    no earnings in excess of the monthly exempt amount in such year
    after the annuity beginning date.
      (6)(A) Except as provided in subparagraph (B) - 
        (i) that portion of the annuity for any month of an individual
      as is computed under section 231b(b) of this title and as
      adjusted under section 231b(g) of this title, plus any
      supplemental amount for such month under section 231b(e) of this
      title, and that portion of the annuity for any month of a spouse
      as is computed under section 231c(b) of this title and as
      adjusted under section 231c(d) of this title, shall each be
      subject to a deduction of $1 for each $2 of compensation received
      by such individual from compensated service rendered in such
      month to the last person, or persons, by whom such individual was
      employed before the date on which the annuity of such individual
      under subsection (a)(1) of this section began to accrue; and
        (ii) that portion of the annuity for any month of a spouse as
      is computed under section 231c(b) of this title and as adjusted
      under section 231c(d) of this title shall be subject to a
      deduction of $1 for each $2 of compensation received by such
      spouse from compensated service rendered in such month to the
      last person, or persons, by whom such spouse was employed before
      the date on which the annuity of such spouse under subsection
      (c)(1) of this section began to accrue.

      (B) Any deductions imposed by this subdivision for any month
    shall not exceed 50 percent of the annuity amount for such month to
    which such deductions apply.
    (g) Employment compensation of survivors; deductions
      (1) No annuity shall be paid to a survivor under subsection (d)
    of this section with respect to any month in which such survivor
    renders service for compensation as an employee of an employer.
    Survivors receiving annuities under subsection (d) of this section
    shall report to the Board immediately all such service for
    compensation.
      (2) Deductions, in amounts and at such time or times as the Board
    shall determine, shall be made from any payments to which a
    survivor is entitled under subsection (d) of this section until the
    total of such deductions equals such survivor's annuity under that
    subsection for any month, if for such month such survivor would be
    charged with excess earnings under section 203(f) of the Social
    Security Act [42 U.S.C. 403(f)] or, having engaged in any activity
    outside the United States, would be charged under such section
    203(f) of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 403(f)] with any
    excess earnings derived from such activity if it had been an
    activity within the United States. For purposes of this subdivision
    the Board shall have the authority to take such actions and to make
    such determinations and such suspensions of payment of benefits in
    the manner and to the extent that the Secretary of Health and Human
    Services would be authorized to take or to make under section
    203(h)(3) of the Social Security Act if the survivors were
    receiving the annuities to which this subdivision applies under
    section 202 of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 402]: Provided,
    however, That in determining a survivor's excess earnings for a
    year for the purposes of this subdivision there shall not be
    included his income from employment or self-employment during
    months beginning with the month with respect to which he ceases to
    be qualified for an annuity. Survivors receiving annuities under
    subsection (d) of this section shall report to the Board the
    receipt of excess earnings described in this subdivision.
    (h) Military service; reductions
      (1) Repealed. Pub. L. 98-76, title IV, Sec. 414(a), Aug. 12,
    1983, 97 Stat. 436.
      (2) The supplemental annuity provided an individual by subsection
    (b) of this section shall, with respect to any month, be reduced by
    the amount of the supplemental pension, attributable to the
    employer's contribution, that such individual is entitled to
    receive for that month under any other supplemental pension plan:
    Provided, however, That the maximum of such reduction shall be
    equal to the amount of the supplemental annuity less any amount by
    which the supplemental pension is reduced by reason of the
    supplemental annuity.
      (3) If a spouse or divorced wife entitled to an annuity under
    subsection (c) of this section or a survivor entitled to an annuity
    under subsection (d) of this section for any month is also entitled
    to annuity under subsection (a)(1) of this section for such month,
    the annuity under subsection (c) or (d) of this section shall be
    reduced, but not below zero, by an amount equal to the annuity
    under subsection (a)(1) of this section: Provided, however, That
    the provisions of this subdivision shall not apply if either the
    spouse or survivor or the individual upon whose earnings record the
    spouse's or survivor's annuity under subsection (c) or (d) of this
    section is based rendered service as an employee to an employer, or
    as an employee representative, prior to January 1, 1975.
      (4) If an annuitant is entitled to more than one annuity under
    subsections (c) and (d) of this section for a month, such annuitant
    shall be entitled to only the larger of such annuities for such
    month, except that, if such annuitant so elects, he shall instead
    be entitled to only the smaller of such annuities for such month.
    (i) Limitation; service accrued after 1995
      An individual entitled to an annuity under this section who has
    completed five years of service, all of which accrues after 1995,
    but who has not completed ten years of service, and the spouse,
    divorced spouse, and survivors of such individual, shall not be
    entitled to an annuity amount provided under section 231b(a),
    section 231c(a), or section 231c(f) of this title unless the
    individual, or the individual's spouse, divorced spouse, or
    survivors, would be entitled to a benefit under title II of the
    Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 401 et seq.] on the basis of the
    individual's employment record under both this subchapter and title
    II of the Social Security Act.

    "If the total amount of such individual's earnings during such year
    (exclusive of earnings for services as described in subdivision (3)
    and after deduction of disability related work expenses) is in
    excess of the annual allowable earnings amount, the number of
    months in such year with respect to which an annuity is not payable
    by reason of the first and third sentences shall not exceed the
    number of months derived by dividing the amount by which such
    annual earnings exceed the annual allowable earnings amount by the
    monthly allowable earning amount determined under this section. If
    the computation under the preceding sentence results in a remainder
    greater than or equal to one-half, the number of months for which
    an annuity is not payable as determined under the preceding
    sentence shall be increased by one. The annual allowable earnings
    amount shall be computed by totaling the amount of monthly
    allowable earnings as determined under the first sentence of this
    subdivision for each month in the calender year. If the amount of
    the individual's annuity has changed during the calendar year, any
    payment of annuities which become payable solely by reason of the
    limitations in the preceding three sentences shall be made first
    with respect to the month or months for which the annuity is
    larger. For purposes of this subdivision, 'the monthly allowable
    earnings' shall be $700, except that for each year after 2007, 'the
    monthly allowable earnings' amount shall be the larger of the
    amount for the previous year or the amount calculated by
    multiplying $700 by the ratio of the national average wage index
    for the year 2 calender years before the year for which the amount
    is being calculated to the national average wage index for the year

    Sec. 231b. Computation of annuities

-STATUTE-
    (a) Amount
      (1) The annuity of an individual under section 231a(a)(1) of this
    title shall be in an amount equal to the amount (before any
    reduction on account of age and before any deductions on account of
    work) of the old-age insurance benefit or disability insurance
    benefit to which such individual would have been entitled under the
    Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 301 et seq.] if all of his or her
    service as an employee after December 31, 1936, had been included
    in the term "employment" as defined in that Act.
      (2) For purposes of this subsection, individuals entitled to an
    annuity under section 231a(a)(1)(ii) of this title shall, except
    for the purposes of recomputations in accordance with section
    215(f) of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 415(f)], be deemed to
    have attained retirement age (as defined by section 216(l) of the
    Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 416(l)]). For purposes of this
    subsection, individuals entitled to an annuity under paragraph (iv)
    or (v) of section 231a(a)(1) of this title shall be deemed to be
    entitled to a disability insurance benefit under section 223 of the
    Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 423].
      (3) If an individual entitled to an annuity under section
    231a(a)(1)(i) or (iii) of this title on the basis of less than ten
    years of service is entitled to a benefit under section 202(a),
    section 202(b), or section 202(c) of the Social Security Act [42
    U.S.C. 402(a), (b), (c)] which began to accrue before the annuity
    under section 231a(a)(1)(i) or (iii) of this title, the annuity
    amount provided such individual under this subsection, shall be
    computed as though the annuity under this subchapter began to
    accrue on the later of (A) the date on which the benefit under
    section 202(a), section 202(b), or section 202(c) of the Social
    Security Act began, or (B) the date on which the individual first
    met the conditions for entitlement to an age reduced annuity under
    this subchapter other than the conditions set forth in sections
    231a(e)(1) and 231a(e)(2) of this title and the requirement that an
    application be filed.
    (b) Increased annuities under subsection (a)
      (1) The amount of the annuity of an individual provided under
    subsection (a) of this section shall be increased by an amount
    equal to seven-tenths of 1 per centum of the product which is
    obtained by multiplying such individual's "years of service" by
    such individual's "average monthly compensation" as determined
    under this subsection. The annuity amount payable to the individual
    under this subsection shall be reduced by 25 per centum of the
    annuity amount computed for such individual under subsection (h)(1)
    or (h)(2), and subsection (h)(5), of this section without regard to
    section 231f(c)(1) of this title. An individual's "average monthly
    compensation" for purposes of this subsection shall be the quotient
    obtained by dividing by 60 such individual's total compensation for
    the 60 months, consecutive or otherwise, during which such
    individual received that individual's highest monthly compensation,
    except that no part of any month's compensation in excess of the
    maximum amount creditable for any individual for such month under
    subsection (j) of this section shall be recognized. In determining
    the months of compensation to be used for purposes of this
    subsection, the total compensation reported for the individual
    under section 231h of this title or credited to such individual
    under subsection (j) of this section for a year divided by the
    number of months of service credited to such individual under
    subsection (i) of this section with respect to such year shall be
    considered the monthly compensation of the individual for each
    month of service in any year for which records of the Board do not
    show the amount of compensation paid to the individual on a monthly
    basis. If the "average monthly compensation" computed under this
    subsection is not a multiple of $1, it shall be rounded to the next
    lower multiple of $1.
      (2) For purposes of subdivision (1) of this subsection, in
    determining "average monthly compensation" for an individual who
    has not engaged in employment for an employer in the 60-month
    period preceding the month in which such individual's annuity began
    to accrue, and whose major employment during such 60-month period
    was for a United States department or agency named in section
    231(o) of this title, the amount of compensation used with respect
    to each month used in making such determination shall be the
    product of - 
        (i) the compensation credited to such individual for such month
      under paragraph (1) of this subsection; and
        (ii) the quotient obtained by dividing - 
          (I) the average of total wages (as determined under section
        215(b)(3)(A)(ii)(I) of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C.
        415(b)(3)(A)(ii)(I)]) for the second calendar year preceding
        the earliest of the year of the individual's death or the year
        in which an annuity begins to accrue to such individual
        (disregarding an annuity based on disability which is
        terminated because such individual has recovered from such
        disability if such individual engages in any regular employment
        after such termination); by
          (II) the average of total wages (as determined under section
        215(b)(3)(A)(ii)(II) of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C.
        415(b)(3)(A)(ii)(II)]) for the calendar year during which such
        month occurred, unless such month occurred prior to calendar
        year 1951, in which case, the average of total wages so
        determined for 1951.

    In no event shall "average monthly compensation" determined for an
    individual under this subdivision exceed the maximum "average
    monthly compensation" which can be determined under subdivision (1)
    of this subsection for any person retiring January 1 of the year in
    which such individual's annuity began to accrue.
    (c), (d) Repealed. Pub. L. 97-35, title XI, Sec. 1118(b), Aug. 13,
      1981, 95 Stat. 631
    (e) Supplemental annuities
      The supplemental annuity of an individual under section 231a(b)
    of this title shall be $23 plus an additional amount of $4 for each
    year of service that the individual has in excess of 25 years, but
    in no case shall the supplemental annuity exceed $43.
    (f) Reductions in annuities
      (1) If, in the case of an individual whose annuity under section
    231a(a)(1) of this title began to accrue prior to January 1, 1983,
    the annuity (before any reduction due to such individual's
    entitlement to a monthly insurance benefit under the Social
    Security Act [42 U.S.C. 301 et seq.] and disregarding any amount
    provided by subsection (h) of this section) plus the supplemental
    annuity to which such individual is entitled for any month under
    this subchapter, together with the annuity, if any, of the spouse
    of such individual (before any reduction due to such spouse's
    entitlement to a wife's or husband's insurance benefit under the
    Social Security Act and disregarding any amount provided by section
    231c(e) of this title), before any reductions under the provisions
    of section 231a(f) of this title is less than the total amount
    which would have been payable to such individual and his spouse for
    such month, on the basis of the individual's compensation and years
    of service, under the provisions of the Railroad Retirement Act of
    1937 as in effect on December 31, 1974 [45 U.S.C. 228a et seq.],
    disregarding, for purposes of the computations under such Railroad
    Retirement Act of 1937 compensation for any month after December
    31, 1974, in excess of one-twelfth of the maximum annual taxable
    "wages" (as defined in section 3121 of the Internal Revenue Code of
    1986 [26 U.S.C. 3121]) for the calendar year 1974, the annuity of
    such individual and the annuity of such spouse, if any, shall be
    increased proportionately so as to equal such total amount. For the
    purpose of computing amounts under this subdivision, the Board
    shall have the authority to approximate the effect of the
    reductions prescribed by sections 3(a)(2) and 3(a)(3) of the
    Railroad Retirement Act of 1937 [45 U.S.C. 228c(a)(2), (a)(3)]. For
    purposes of computing amounts payable under the Railroad Retirement
    Act of 1937, any increases in the amounts determined under the
    first proviso of section 3(e) of such Act which would have become
    effective after December 31, 1974, shall be disregarded.
      (2) If for any month in which an annuity accrues and is payable
    under this subchapter the annuity to which an individual is
    entitled under this subchapter (or would have been entitled except
    for a reduction pursuant to a joint and survivor election),
    together with the annuity, if any, of the spouse and divorced wife
    of such individual, is less than the total amount, or the
    additional amount, which would have been payable to all persons for
    such month under the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 301 et seq.] if
    such individual's service as an employee after December 31, 1936,
    were included in the term "employment" as defined in that Act, the
    annuities of the individual and spouse shall be increased
    proportionately to such total amount, or such additional amount:
    Provided, however, That if an annuity accrues to an individual or a
    spouse for a part of a month, the amount payable for such part of a
    month under this subdivision shall be one-thirtieth of the amount
    payable under this subdivision for an entire month, multiplied by
    the number of days in such part of a month. For purposes of this
    subdivision, (i) persons not entitled to an annuity under section
    231a of this title shall not be included in the computation under
    this subdivision except a spouse who could qualify for an annuity
    under section 231a(c) of this title if the individual from whom the
    spouse's annuity under this subchapter would derive had attained
    age 60 or 62, as the case may be, and such individual's children
    who meet the definition as such contained in section 216(e) of the
    Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 416(e)]; (ii) after an annuity has
    been certified for payment and this subdivision was inapplicable
    after allowing for any waiting period under section 223(c)(2) of
    the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 423(c)(2)], and after having
    considered the inclusion of all persons who were then eligible for
    inclusion in the computation under this subdivision, or was then
    applicable but later became inapplicable, any recertification in
    such annuity under this subdivision shall not take into account
    persons not entitled to an annuity under section 231a of this title
    except a spouse who could qualify for an annuity under section
    231a(c) of this title when she attains age 60 or 62, as the case
    may be, if the individual from whom the spouse's annuity would
    derive had attained age 60 or 62, as the case may be, and who was
    married to such individual at the time he applied for his annuity;
    and (iii) in computing the amount to be paid under this subdivision
    the only benefits under title II of the Social Security Act [42
    U.S.C. 401 et seq.] which shall be considered shall be those to
    which the persons included in the computation are entitled.
    (g) Increased annuities under subsection (b)
      (1) Effective with the date of any increase after January 31,
    1984, in monthly insurance benefits under the Social Security Act
    [42 U.S.C. 301 et seq.] which occurs, or which would have occurred
    had there not been a general benefit increase under that Act,
    pursuant to the automatic cost-of-living provisions of section
    215(i) of that Act [42 U.S.C. 415(i)], that portion of the annuity
    of an individual which is computed under subsection (b) of this
    section shall, if such individual's annuity under section
    231a(a)(1) of this title began to accrue on or before the effective
    date of a particular increase under this subdivision, be increased
    by 32.5 per centum of the percentage increase in the index which is
    used, or which would have been used had there not been a general
    benefit increase under the Social Security Act, in increasing
    benefits under the Social Security Act pursuant to the automatic
    cost-of-living provisions of section 215(i) of that Act. Any
    increase under this subsection shall not be deferred and shall be
    reflected in all payments made to annuitants after such increase
    under this subsection becomes effective.
      (2) The first and, if necessary, the following time or times
    after January 1, 1983, that monthly insurance benefits under
    section 202 of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 402] are
    increased, that portion of the annuity of an individual which is
    computed under subsection (b) of this section as increased under
    subdivision (1) of this subsection shall, if such individual's
    annuity under section 231a(a)(1) of this title began to accrue in
    or before the year in which such first increase under the Social
    Security Act [42 U.S.C. 301 et seq.] became effective, be reduced
    by the dollar amount by which that portion of the annuity provided
    such individual under subsection (a) of this section was increased,
    after any reduction under subsection (m) of this section, as a
    result of such increase or increases under the Social Security Act
    until the total dollar amount of such reduction or reductions
    equals 5 per centum of the annuity amount provided such individual
    under subsection (a) of this section, as reduced under subsection
    (m) of this section, prior to such first increase. In no case shall
    the reduction by reason of this paragraph operate to reduce such
    portion to an amount less than $10.
    (h) Increased annuities under subsections (a) and (b)
      (1) The amount of the annuity provided under subsections (a) and
    (b) of this section of an individual who (A) will have (i) rendered
    service as an employee to an employer, or as an employee
    representative, during the calendar year 1974, or (ii) had a
    current connection with the railroad industry on December 31, 1974,
    or at the time his annuity under section 231a(a)(1) of this title
    began to accrue, or (iii) completed twenty-five years of service
    prior to January 1, 1975, and (B) will have (i) completed ten years
    of service prior to January 1, 1975, and (ii) been permanently
    insured under the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 301 et seq.] on
    December 31, 1974, shall be increased by an amount equal to the
    amount by which (C) the sum of (i) the primary insurance amount to
    which such individual would have been entitled, upon the attainment
    of age 65 (or, if later, for January 1975), under the provisions of
    the Social Security Act as in effect on December 31, 1974, if his
    service as an employee after December 31, 1936, and prior to
    January 1, 1975, were included in the term "employment" as defined
    in that Act and if he had no wages or self-employment income under
    that Act other than wages derived from such service as an employee,
    and (ii) the primary insurance amount to which such individual
    would have been entitled, upon the attainment of age 65 (or, if
    later, for January 1975), under the provisions of the Social
    Security Act as in effect on December 31, 1974, on the basis of his
    wages and self-employment income derived from employment and self-
    employment under that Act prior to January 1, 1975, exceeds (D)
    the primary insurance amount to which such individual would have
    been entitled, upon the attainment of age 65 (or, if later, for
    January 1975), under the provisions of the Social Security Act as
    in effect on December 31, 1974, on the basis of his wages and self-
    employment income derived from employment and self-employment
    under that Act prior to January 1, 1975, and on the basis of
    compensation derived from service as an employee after December 31,
    1936, and prior to January 1, 1975, if such service as an employee
    had been included in the term "employment" as defined in that Act.
      (2) The amount of the annuity provided under subsections (a) and
    (b) of this section to an individual who (A) will not have met the
    conditions set forth in subclause (i), (ii), or (iii) of clause (A)
    of subdivision (1) of this subsection, but (B) will have (i)
    completed ten years of service prior to January 1, 1975, and (ii)
    been permanently insured under the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C.
    301 et seq.] as of December 31 of the calendar year prior to 1975
    in which he last rendered service as an employee to an employer, or
    as an employee representative, shall be increased by an amount
    equal to the amount by which (C) the sum of (i) the primary
    insurance amount to which such individual would have been entitled,
    upon the attainment of age 65 (or, if later, for January 1975),
    under the provisions of the Social Security Act as in effect on
    December 31, 1974, if his service as an employee after December 31,
    1936, and prior to January 1, 1975, were included in the term
    "employment" as defined in that Act and if he had no wages or self-
    employment income under that Act other than wages derived from
    such service as an employee, and (ii) the primary insurance amount
    to which such individual would have been entitled, upon the
    attainment of age 65 (or, if later, for January 1975), under the
    provisions of the Social Security Act as in effect on December 31,
    1974, on the basis of his wages and self-employment income derived
    from employment and self-employment under that Act as of December
    31 of the calendar year prior to 1975 in which he last performed
    service as an employee under this subchapter, exceeds (D) the
    primary insurance amount to which such individual would have been
    entitled, upon the attainment of age 65 (or, if later, for January
    1975), under the provisions of the Social Security Act as in effect
    on December 31, 1974, on the basis of his wages and self-employment
    income derived from employment and self-employment under that Act
    as of December 31 of the calendar year prior to 1975 in which he
    last performed service as an employee under this subchapter and on
    the basis of compensation derived from service as an employee after
    December 31, 1936, and prior to January 1, 1975, if such service as
    an employee had been included in the term "employment" as defined
    in that Act.
      (3) The amount of the annuity provided under subsections (a) and
    (b) of this section of an individual who (A) will have (i) rendered
    service as an employee to an employer, or as an employee
    representative, during the calendar year 1974, or (ii) had a
    current connection with the railroad industry on December 31, 1974,
    or at the time his annuity under section 231a(a)(1) of this title
    began to accrue, or (iii) completed twenty-five years of service
    prior to January 1, 1975, and (B) will have completed ten years of
    service prior to January 1, 1975, and is the wife, husband, widow,
    or widower of a person who will have been permanently insured under
    the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 301 et seq.] on December 31,
    1974, shall be increased by an amount equal to the smaller of (C)
    the wife's, husband's, widow's, or widower's insurance benefit to
    which such individual would have been entitled, upon attaining age
    65 (or, if later, for January 1975), under the provisions of the
    Social Security Act as in effect on December 31, 1974, on the basis
    of such person's wages and self-employment income derived from
    employment and self-employment under that Act prior to January 1,
    1975, or (D) the primary insurance amount to which such individual
    would have been entitled upon attaining age 65 (or, if later, for
    January 1975), under the provisions of the Social Security Act as

    in that Act.
      (4) The amount of the annuity provided under subsections (a) and
    (b) of this section of an individual who (A) will not have met the
    conditions set forth in subclause (i), (ii), or (iii) of clause (A)
    of subdivision (3) of this subsection, but (B) will have completed
    ten years of service prior to January 1, 1975, and is the wife,
    husband, widow, or widower of a person who will have been
    permanently insured under the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 301 et
    seq.] as of December 31 of the calendar year prior to 1975 in which
    such individual last rendered service as an employee to an
    employer, or as an employee representative, shall be increased by
    an amount equal to the smaller of (C) the wife's, husband's,
    widow's, or widower's insurance benefit to which such individual
    would have been entitled, upon attaining age 65 (or, if later, for
    January 1975), under the provisions of the Social Security Act as
    in effect on December 31, 1974, on the basis of such person's wages
    and self-employment income derived from employment and self-
    employment under that Act as of December 31 of the calendar year
    prior to 1975 in which such individual last performed service as an
    employee under this subchapter or (D) the primary insurance amount
    to which such individual would have been entitled upon attaining
    age 65 (or, if later, for January 1975), under the provisions of
    the Social Security Act as in effect on December 31, 1974, on the
    basis of such individual's wages and self-employment income derived
    from employment and self-employment under that Act as of December
    31 of the calendar year prior to 1975 in which such individual last
    performed service as an employee under this subchapter and on the
    basis of compensation derived from service as an employee after
    December 31, 1936, and prior to January 1, 1975, if such service as
    an employee had been included in the term "employment" as defined
    in that Act.
      (5) The amount computed under subdivision (1), (2), (3), or (4)
    of this subsection shall be increased by the same percentage, or
    percentages, as benefits under the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C.
    301 et seq.] are increased, or would have been increased had there
    been no general benefit increases under the Social Security Act,
    pursuant to the automatic cost-of-living provisions of section
    215(i) of that Act [42 U.S.C. 415(i)] during the period from
    January 1, 1975, to the earlier of the date on which the
    individual's annuity under section 231a(a)(1) of this title began
    to accrue or January 1, 1982.
      (6) No amount shall be payable to an individual under subdivision
    (3) or (4) of this subsection unless the entitlement of such
    individual to such amount had been determined prior to August 13,
    1981.
    (i) Years of service
      (1) The "years of service" of an individual shall include all his
    service subsequent to December 31, 1936.
      (2) The "years of service" of an individual shall also include
    his voluntary or involuntary military service, within or without
    the United States, during any war service period: Provided,
    however, That such military service shall be included only if,
    prior to the beginning of his military service and in the same
    calendar year in which such military service began, or in the next
    preceding calendar year, the individual rendered service for
    compensation to an employer or to a person service to which is
    otherwise creditable under this subchapter, or lost time as an
    employee for which he received remuneration, or was serving as an
    employee representative: Provided further, That such military
    service shall be included only subject to and in accordance with
    the provisions of subdivisions (1) and (3) of this subsection in
    the same manner as though military service were service rendered as
    an employee: And provided further, That such military service
    rendered after December 1956 shall not be included with respect to
    any month if (A) any benefits are payable for that month under the
    Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 301 et seq.] on the basis of such
    individual's wages and self-employment income, (B) such military
    service was included in the computation of such benefits, and (C)
    the inclusion of such military service in the computation of such
    benefits resulted (for that month) in benefits not otherwise
    payable or in an increase in the benefits otherwise payable: And
    provided further, That an individual who entered military service
    prior to a war service period shall not be regarded as having been
    in military service in a war service period with respect to any
    part of the period for which he entered such military service.
      (3) The "years of service" of an individual who was an employee
    on August 29, 1935, shall, if the total number of his "years of
    service" as determined under subdivisions (1) and (2) is less than
    thirty, also include his service prior to January 1, 1937, but not
    so as to make his total years of service exceed thirty: Provided,
    however, That with respect to any such individual who rendered
    service to any employer subsequent to December 31, 1936, and who on
    August 29, 1935, was not an employee of an employer conducting the
    principal part of its business in the United States, no greater
    proportion of his service rendered prior to January 1, 1937, shall
    be included in his "years of service" than the proportion which his
    total compensation (without regard to any limitation on the amount
    of compensation otherwise provided in this subchapter) for service
    subsequent to December 31, 1936, rendered anywhere to an employer
    conducting the principal part of its business in the United States
    or rendered in the United States to any other employer bears to his
    total compensation (without regard to any limitation on the amount
    of compensation otherwise provided in this subchapter) for service
    rendered anywhere to an employer subsequent to December 31, 1936.
    Where the "years of service" include only part of the service prior
    to January 1, 1937, the part included shall be taken in reverse
    order beginning with the last calendar month of such service.
      (4) Where for any calendar year after 1984 an individual has
    performed service for compensation in less than twelve months of
    the calendar year but has received compensation in excess of an
    amount determined by multiplying the number of months in the year
    in which such individual performed service for compensation by an
    amount equal to one-twelfth of the current maximum annual taxable
    "wages" as defined in section 3121 of the Internal Revenue Code of
    1986 [26 U.S.C. 3121], the individual shall be deemed to have
    rendered service for compensation in that number of months in the
    calendar year, but not to exceed twelve, which is equal to the
    quotient of the amount of such individual's compensation for the
    calendar year divided by an amount equal to one-twelfth of the
    current maximum annual taxable "wages" as defined in section 3121
    of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, with any remainder produced
    by this computation increasing the quotient by one, but an
    individual shall not be deemed under this subdivision to have
    rendered service for compensation in any month in which such
    individual was neither in an employment relation to one or more
    employers nor an employee representative.
    (j) Average monthly compensation
      The "average monthly compensation" shall be computed in the
    manner specified in subsection (b) of this section, except (1) that
    with respect to service prior to January 1, 1937, the monthly
    compensation shall be the average compensation paid to an employee
    with respect to calendar months included in his years of service in
    the years 1924-1931, and (2) the amount of compensation paid or
    attributable as paid to him with respect to each month of service
    before September 1941 as a station employee whose duties consisted
    of or included the carrying of passengers' hand baggage and
    otherwise assisting passengers at passenger stations and whose
    remuneration for service to the employer was, in whole or in
    substantial part, in the forms of tips, shall be the monthly
    average of the compensation paid to him as a station employee in
    his months of service in the period September 1940 through August
    1941: Provided, however, That where service in the period 1924
    through 1931 in the one case, or in the period September 1940
    through August 1941 in the other case, is, in the judgment of the
    Board, insufficient to constitute a fair and equitable basis for
    determing (!1) the amount of compensation paid or attributable as
    paid to him in each month of service before 1937, or September
    1941, respectively, the Board shall determine the amount of such
    compensation for each such month in such manner as in its judgment
    shall be fair and equitable. In computing the monthly compensation,
    no part of any month's compensation in excess of $300 for any month
    before July 1, 1954, or in excess of $350 for any month after June
    30, 1954, and before June 1, 1959, or in excess of $400 for any
    month after May 31, 1959, and before November 1, 1963, or in excess
    of $450 for any month after October 31, 1963, and before October 1,
    1965, or in excess of (i) $450, or (ii) an amount equal to one-
    twelfth of the current maximum annual taxable "wages" as defined
    in section 3121 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 [26 U.S.C.
    3121], whichever is greater, for any month after September 30,
    1965, shall be recognized. If for any calendar year after 1984 an
    employee has received compensation of less than one-twelfth of the
    current maximum annual taxable "wages" as defined in section 3121
    of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 in one or more months of the
    calendar year, the total compensation paid such employee in the
    calendar year (without regard to the limitation on the amount of
    compensation provided in the preceding sentence) shall be deemed to
    have been paid in equal proportions with respect to all months in
    the year in which the employee will have been in the service of one
    or more employers for compensation or will have performed service
    for compensation as an employee representative, but this sentence
    shall not operate to increase the employee's compensation for any
    month above an amount equal to one-twelfth of the current maximum
    annual taxable "wages" as defined in section 3121 of the Internal
    Revenue Code of 1986. If the employee earned compensation in
    service after June 30, 1937, and after the last day of the calendar
    year in which he attained age sixty-five, such compensation and
    service shall be disregarded in computing the average monthly
    compensation if the result of taking such compensation into account
    in such computation would be to diminish his annuity. Where an
    employee claims credit for months of service rendered within two
    years prior to his retirement from the service of an employer, with
    respect to which the employer's return pursuant to section 231h of
    this title has not been entered on the records of the Board before
    the employee's annuity could otherwise be certified for payment,
    the Board may, in its discretion (subject to subsequent adjustment
    at the request of the employee) include such months in the
    computation of the annuity without further verification and may
    consider the compensation for such months to be the average of the
    compensation for months in the last period for which the employer
    has filed a return of the compensation of such employee and such
    return has been entered on the records of the Board.

    (k) Employee representatives
      The annuity of an individual who shall have been an employee
    representative shall be determined in the same manner and with the
    same effect as if the employee organization by which he shall have
    been employed were an employer.
    (l) Reductions for increased annuities
      (1) Except as provided in subdivision (2) of this subsection, if
    an annuity awarded under section 231a(a)(1)(iii) of this title or
    under section 231a(c)(2) of this title is increased or decreased
    either by a change in the law or by a recomputation, the reduction
    on account of age in the amount of such increase or decrease shall
    be computed as though such increased or decreased annuity amount
    had been in effect for and after the month in which the annuitant
    first became entitled to such annuity under section 231a(a)(1)(iii)
    or section 231a(c)(2) of this title.
      (2) The reduction required under section 231a(a)(1)(iii) or
    section 231a(c)(2) of this title may be applied separately to each
    of the annuity amounts computed under subsections (a), (b), and (h)
    of this section and subsections (a), (b), and (e) of section 231c
    of this title. For this purpose, in any case in which an annuity
    amount was computed for an individual under the provisions of this
    subchapter or of Public Law 93-445 prior to October 1, 1981, an
    annuity amount computed under subsections (a), (b), (c), (d) and
    (h) of this section, subsection (a), (b), or (e) of section 231c of
    this title, and section 204 or section 206 of Public Law 93-445
    shall be reduced by its proportionate share of the reduction on
    account of age. For purposes of the preceding sentence, annuity
    amounts computed for an individual under subsections (b), (c), and
    (d) of this section prior to October 1981 shall be considered as
    one annuity amount.
    (m) Reductions due to monthly social security payments
      The annuity of any individual under subsection (a) of this
    section for any month shall, after any reduction pursuant to
    paragraph (iii) of section 231a(a)(1) of this title, be reduced,
    but not below zero, by the amount of any monthly benefit (before
    any deductions on account of work) payable to that individual for
    that month under title II of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 401
    et seq.].

      2001 - Subsec. (a)(2). Pub. L. 107-90, Sec. 102(a), inserted
    after par. designation "For purposes of this subsection,
    individuals entitled to an annuity under section 231a(a)(1)(ii) of
    this title shall, except for the purposes of recomputations in
    accordance with section 215(f) of the Social Security Act, be
    deemed to have attained retirement age (as defined by section
    216(l) of the Social Security Act)."
      Subsec. (a)(3). Pub. L. 107-90, Sec. 103(b), added par. (3).
      Pub. L. 107-90, Sec. 102(c), struck out par. (3) which read as
    follows: "In lieu of an annuity amount provided under subdivision
    (1), the annuity of an individual entitled to an annuity under
    paragraph (ii) of section 231a(a)(1) of this title which begins to
    accrue before the individual attains age 62 shall be in an amount
    equal to - 
        "(i) for each month prior to the first month throughout which
      the individual is age 62, the amount (after any reduction on
      account of age but before any deductions on account of work) of
      the old-age insurance benefit to which such individual would have
      been entitled under the Social Security Act as of the date on
      which such individual's annuity begins to accrue if such
      individual had attained age 62 on the first day of the month in
      which his or her annuity begins to accrue and if all of such
      individual's service as an employee after December 31, 1936, had
      been included in the term 'employment' as defined in that Act,
      using for purposes of this computation the number of benefit
      computation years applicable to a person born in the year in
      which such individual was born; and
        "(ii) for months beginning with the first month throughout
      which the individual is age 62, the amount (after any reduction
      on account of age but before any deductions on account of work)
      of the old-age insurance benefit to which such individual would
      have been entitled under the Social Security Act if all of such
      individual's service as an employee after December 31, 1936, had
      been included in the term 'employment' as defined in that Act."
      Subsec. (f). Pub. L. 107-90, Sec. 104(a)(1), (2)(A), redesignated
    pars. (2) and (3) as (1) and (2), respectively, struck out ",
    without regard to the provisions of subdivision (1) of this
    subsection," before "proportionately so as to equal" in first
    sentence of par. (1), and struck out former par. (1) which read as
    follows: "If the total amount of an individual's annuity and
    supplemental annuity computed under the preceding subsections of
    this section would, before any reductions on account of age, before
    any reduction due to such individual's entitlement to a monthly
    insurance benefit under the Social Security Act, and disregarding
    any increases in such total amount which become effective after the
    date on which such individual's annuity under section 231a(a)(1) of
    this title begins to accrue, exceed an amount equal to the sum of
    (A) 100 per centum of his 'final average monthly compensation' up
    to an amount equal to 50 per centum of one-twelfth of the maximum
    annual taxable 'wages' (as defined in section 3121 of the Internal
    Revenue Code of 1986) for the calendar year in which such
    individual's annuity under section 231a(a)(1) of this title begins
    to accrue, plus (B) 80 per centum of so much of his 'final average
    monthly compensation' as exceeds 50 per centum of one-twelfth of
    the maximum annual taxable 'wages' (as defined in section 3121 of
    the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) for the calendar year in which
    such individual's annuity under section 231a(a)(1) of this title
    begins to accrue, the supplemental annuity of such individual
    first, and then, if necessary, the annuity amount of such
    individual as computed under subsection (b) of this section, shall
    be reduced until such total amount of such individual's annuity and
    supplemental annuity equals such sum or until such supplemental
    annuity and such annuity amount computed under subsection (b) of
    this section are reduced to zero, whichever occurs first: Provided,
    however, That the provisions of this subdivision shall not operate
    to reduce the total amount of an individual's annuity and
    supplemental annuity computed under the preceding subsections of
    this section below $1,200. For purposes of this subdivision, the
    'final average monthly compensation' of an individual shall except
    as provided in the following sentence be determined by dividing the
    total compensation received by such individual in the two calendar
    years, consecutive or otherwise, in which he was credited with the
    highest total compensation during the ten-year period ending with
    December 31 of the year in which such individual's annuity under
    section 231a(a)(1) of this title begins to accrue by 24. If the
    individual's 'average monthly compensation' is determined under
    subdivision (2) of subsection (b) of this section, the 'final
    average monthly compensation' for such individual shall be the
    average of the compensation for the 24 months in which the
    compensation determined for the purpose of subdivision (2) of
    subsection (b) of this section is the highest. For purposes of this
    subdivision, the term 'compensation' shall include 'compensation'
    as defined in section 231(h) of this title, 'wages' as defined in
    section 209 of the Social Security Act, 'self-employment income' as
    defined in section 211(b) of the Social Security Act, and wages
    deemed to have been paid under section 217 or 229 of the Social
    Security Act on account of military service: Provided, however,
    That in no case shall the compensation with respect to any calendar
    month exceed the limitation on the compensation for such month
    prescribed in subsection (j) of this section. Wages and self-
    employment income included as compensation for purposes of this
    subdivision shall, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, be
    presumed to have been paid in equal proportions with respect to all
    months in the calendar quarter in which credited, in the case of
    wages paid before 1978, or in equal proportions with respect to all
    months in the calendar year in which credited, in the case of self-
    employment income and in the case of wages paid after 1977."
      1986 - Subsecs. (f)(1), (2), (i)(4), (j). Pub. L. 99-514
    substituted "Internal Revenue Code of 1986" for "Internal Revenue
    Code of 1954" wherever appearing.
      1983 - Subsec. (a)(2). Pub. L. 98-76, Sec. 101(a)(1), amended
    par. (2) generally, substituting provisions that for purposes of
    this subsection, individuals entitled to an annuity under section
    231a(a)(1)(iv) or (v) of this title shall be deemed to be entitled
    to a disability insurance benefit under section 223 of the Social
    Security Act, for provisions that for purposes of this subsection,
    individuals entitled to an annuity under paragraph (ii) of section
    231a(a)(1) of this title would except for purposes of
    recomputations in accordance with the provisions of section 215(f)
    of the Social Security Act, be deemed to have attained age 65, and
    individuals entitled to an annuity under paragraph (iv) or (v) of
    such section 231a(a)(1) of this title would be deemed to be
    entitled to a disability insurance benefit under section 223 of the
    Social Security Act.
      Subsec. (a)(3). Pub. L. 98-76, Sec. 101(a)(2), added par. (3).

    'average monthly compensation' is determined under subdivision (2)
    of subsection (b) of this section, the 'final average monthly
    compensation' for such individual shall be the average of the
    compensation for the 24 months in which the compensation determined
    for the purpose of subdivision (2) of subsection (b) of this
    section is the highest."
      Subsec. (f)(3). Pub. L. 98-76, Sec. 405(a), in first sentence,
    inserted "and divorced wife" after "of the spouse", and substituted
    "the annuities of the individual and spouse" for "such annuity or
    annuities".
      Subsec. (g). Pub. L. 98-76, Sec. 102(a), amended subsec. (g)
    generally. Prior to amendment, subsec. (g) read as follows:
    "Effective with the month of June for any year after 1981, that
    portion of the annuity of an individual which is computed under
    subsection (b) of this section shall, if such individual's annuity
    under section 231a(a)(1) of this title began to accrue on or before
    June 1 of such year, be increased by 32.5 per centum of the
    percentage increase, if any (rounded to the nearest one-tenth of 1
    per centum), obtained by comparing (A) the unadjusted Consumer
    Price Index for the calendar quarter ending March 31 of such year
    with (B) the higher of (i) such index for the calendar quarter
    ending March 31 of the year immediately preceding such year or (ii)
    such index for the calendar quarter ending March 31 of any
    preceding year after 1980. The unadjusted Consumer Price Index for
    any calendar quarter shall be the arithmetical mean of such index
    for the three months in such quarter."
      Subsec. (i)(4). Pub. L. 98-76, Sec. 107(a), added par. (4).
      Subsec. (j). Pub. L. 98-76, Sec. 107(b), inserted provision that
    if for any calendar year after 1984 an employee has received
    compensation of less than one-twelfth of the current maximum annual
    taxable "wages" as defined in section 3121 of the Internal Revenue
    Code of 1954 in one or more months of the calendar year, the total
    compensation paid such employee in the calendar year (without
    regard to the limitation on the amount of compensation provided in
    the preceding sentence) shall be deemed to have been paid in equal
    proportions with respect to all months in the year in which the
    employee will have been in the service of one or more employers for
    compensation or will have performed service for compensation as an
    employee representative, but this sentence shall not operate to
    increase the employee's compensation for any month above an amount
    equal to one-twelfth of the current maximum annual taxable "wages"
    as defined in section 3121 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954.

    which provided for amount of increase of annuity of an individual
    entitled to an annuity under section 231a(a)(1) of this title and

    individual's annuity under section 231a(a)(1) of this title begins

    begins to accrue, exceed an amount equal to the sum of individual's
    annuity under section 231a(a)(1) of this title (A)".
      Pub. L. 97-35, Sec. 1118(c)(1), substituted "subsection (b) of
    this section" for "subsections (b), (c), and (d) of this section"
    in two places.
      Subsec. (g). Pub. L. 97-35, Sec. 1118(d), substituted new formula
    for increase of portion of annuity of an individual computed under

    this section, and revised effective dates for such increases.
      Subsec. (h)(1) to (4). Pub. L. 97-35, Sec. 1118(e)(1),

    title began to accrue".
      Subsec. (h)(6). Pub. L. 97-35, Sec. 1118(e)(3), added subdiv.
    (6).

    of average monthly compensation by reference to computation in
    manner specified in subsec. (b) of this section, for definition by
    reference to average compensation paid to an employee with respect
    to calendar months included in his years of service, and struck out
    provision rounding to next lower multiple of $1 if average monthly
    compensation is not a multiple of $1.
      Subsec. (l). Pub. L. 97-35, Sec. 1118(g), designated existing
    provisions as subdiv. (1), substituted provisions that except as
    provided in subdiv. (2) of this subsection, if an annuity awarded
    under section 231a(a)(1)(iii) or under section 231a(c)(2) of this
    title is increased or decreased either by a change in law or by a
    recomputation, the reduction on account of age in the amount of
    such increase or decrease shall be computed as though such
    increased or decreased annuity amount had been in effect for and
    after month in which annuitant first became entitled to such
    annuity under section 231a(a)(1)(iii) or section 231a(c)(2) of this
    title, for provisions that in cases where an annuity awarded under
    section 231a(a)(1)(iii) or under section 231a(c)(2) of this title
    is increased either by a change in law or by a recomputation, the
    reduction for the increase in the annuity shall be determined
    separately and period with respect to which the reduction applies
    shall be determined as if such increase were a separate annuity
    payable for and after first month for which such increase is
    effective, and added subdiv. (2).

    wages paid before 1978, or in equal proportions with respect to all

    (a) Amount of spouses' annuities; age
      (1) The annuity of a spouse or divorced wife of an individual
    under section 231a(c) of this title shall be in an amount equal to
    the amount (before any reduction on account of age and before any
    deductions on account of work) of the wife's insurance benefit or
    the husband's insurance benefit to which such spouse or divorced
    wife would have been entitled under the Social Security Act [42
    U.S.C. 301 et seq.] if such individual's service as an employee
    after December 31, 1936, had been included in the term "employment"
    as defined in that Act.
      (2) For purposes of this subsection, a spouse entitled to an
    annuity under section 231a(c)(1)(ii)(B) of this title shall be
    deemed to have attained retirement age (as defined in section
    216(l) of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 416(l)] (!1).

      (3) If a spouse entitled to an annuity under section
    231a(c)(1)(ii)(A), section 231a(c)(1)(ii)(C), or section 231a(c)(2)
    of this title or a divorced spouse entitled to an annuity under
    section 231a(c)(4) of this title on the basis of the employment
    record of an employee who will have completed less than 10 years of
    service is entitled to a benefit under section 202(a), section
    202(b), or section 202(c) of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C.
    402(a), (b), (c)] which began to accrue before the annuity under
    section 231a(c)(1)(ii)(A), section 231a(c)(1)(ii)(C), section
    231a(c)(2), or section 231a(c)(4) of this title, the annuity amount
    provided under this subsection shall be computed as though the
    annuity under this subchapter began to accrue on the later of (A)
    the date on which the benefit under section 202(a), section 202(b),
    or section 202(c) of the Social Security Act began or (B) the first
    date on which the annuitant met the conditions for entitlement to
    an age reduced annuity under this subchapter other than the
    conditions set forth in sections 231a(e)(1) and 231a(e)(2) of this
    title and the requirement that an application be filed.

      231b(b), (c), (d) of this title
      The amount of the annuity of a spouse of an individual provided

    amount equal to 45 per centum of that portion of the individual's
    annuity as is computed under subsection (b) of section 231b of this
    title: Provided, however, That if the spouse is entitled to an
    annuity amount provided by subsection (e)(1) or (e)(2) of this
    section, the amount of such spouse's annuity provided by the
    preceding provisions of this subsection shall be reduced by the
    amount by which the amount computed in accordance with the
    provisions of clause (C) of subsection (e)(1) or (e)(2) of this
    section was increased by the Social Security Amendments of 1965,
    1967, and 1969, disregarding (A) the amount of any such increase
    resulting from the Social Security Amendments of 1967 equal to, or
    less than, the excess of $5 over 5.8 per centum of the lesser of
    (i) the amount computed under clause (C) of subsection (e)(1) or
    (e)(2) of this section before any increases derived from
    legislation enacted after the Social Security Amendments of 1967 or
    (ii) the amount of the spouse's annuity to which such spouse would
    have been entitled under section 2(e) of the Railroad Retirement
    Act of 1937 [45 U.S.C. 228b(e)], without regard to section 3(a)(2)
    of that Act [45 U.S.C. 228c(a)(2)] or to increases derived from
    legislation enacted after 1968 and before any reduction on account
    of age, on the basis of the individual's compensation and years of
    service prior to January 1, 1975, and (B) the amount of any such
    increase resulting from the Social Security Amendments of 1969
    equal to, or less than, $5: Provided further, That if the spouse is
    entitled to an annuity under section 231a(a)(1) of this title, the
    amount of the annuity of such spouse under this subsection
    shall,(!2) be increased by an amount equal to the amount by which
    the amount of the annuity of such spouse provided under subsection
    (a) of this section was reduced by reason of the provisions of
    subsection (i)(2) of this section (disregarding, for this purpose,
    any increase in such reduction which becomes effective after the
    later of the date such spouse's annuity under section 231a(c) of
    this title began to accrue or the date such spouse's annuity under
    section 231a(a)(1) of this title began to accrue). The Board shall
    have the authority to approximate the amount of any reduction
    prescribed by the first proviso of this subsection.

    increased by the same percentage, or percentages, as the
    individual's annuity is, or has been, increased pursuant to the
    provisions of section 231b(g)(1) of this title.
      (2) That portion of the annuity of the spouse of an individual as
    is determined under subsection (b) of this section prior to any
    determination under subsection (c) of this subsection (!3) shall,
    if the annuity of such spouse is not subject to reduction under
    subdivision (3) of this subsection, be reduced by an amount equal
    to 50 per centum of the dollar amount by which the annuity of the
    individual was reduced under section 231b(g)(2) of this title. In
    no case shall the reduction by reason of this paragraph operate to
    reduce such portion to an amount less than $10.

      (3) The first and, if necessary, the following time or times
    after January 1, 1983, that monthly insurance benefits under
    section 202 of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 402] are
    increased, that portion of the annuity of the spouse of an
    individual as is determined under subsections (b), (c), and (d)(1)
    of this section shall, if such spouse's annuity under section
    231a(c) of this title began to accrue in or before the year in
    which such first increase under the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C.
    301 et seq.] became effective, be reduced by the dollar amount by
    which that portion of the annuity provided such spouse under
    subsection (a) of this section was increased, after any reduction
    under subsection (i) of this section, as a result of such increase
    or increases under the Social Security Act until the total dollar
    amount of such reduction or reductions equals 5 per centum of the
    annuity amount provided such spouse under subsection (a) of this
    section, as reduced under subsection (i) of this section, prior to
    such first increase. In no case shall the reduction by reason of
    this paragraph operate to reduce such portion to an amount less
    than $10.
    (e) Increases in particular spouses' annuities
      (1) The amount of the annuity of the spouse of an individual
    determined under subsections (a) and (b) of this section, if (A)

    to which such spouse would have been entitled, upon attaining age

    after December 31, 1936, and prior to January 1, 1975, were
    included in the term "employment" as defined in that Act, if such
    individual had no wages or self-employment income under the Act
    other than wages derived from such service as an employee, and if
    such spouse were entitled to no other benefit under that Act:

    year prior to 1975 in which such individual last rendered service

    such deceased employee's service as an employee after December 31,
    1936, had been included in the term "employment" as defined in that

    U.S.C. 415(a)] as in effect on December 31, 1974, after reduction
    in accordance with the provisions of section 202(k) and 202(q) of
    that Act [42 U.S.C. 402(k), (q)] in the same manner as would be

    benefit payable under section 202(e) or 202(f) of that Act.
      (2) For purposes of this subsection - 
        (i) a widow or widower or a parent who is entitled to an
      annuity based on age under section 231a(d)(1) of this title and
      who has not attained age 62 shall be deemed to be age 62:
      Provided, however, That the provisions of this paragraph shall
      not apply in the case of a widow or widower who was entitled to
      an annuity under section 231a(d)(1) of this title on the basis of
      disability for the month before the month in which he or she
      attained age 60,
        (ii) a widow or widower or a child who is entitled to an
      annuity under section 231a(d)(1) of this title on the basis of
      disability shall be deemed to be entitled to a widow's insurance
      benefit, a widower's insurance benefit, or a child's insurance
      benefit under the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 301 et seq.] on
      the basis of disability, and
        (iii) The (!4) provisions of paragraphs (i) and (ii) of this
      subdivision shall not apply to the annuity of a widow, surviving
      divorced wife, or surviving divorced mother who is entitled to
      such annuity on the basis of the provisions of section
      231a(d)(1)(v) of this title.


      (3) The annuity amount provided to a widow or widower under last
    sentence of subdivision (1) shall be increased by the same
    percentage or percentages as insurance benefits payable under
    section 202 of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 402] are
    increased after the date on which such annuity begins to accrue.
    (g) Increases in survivor's annuities in accordance with subsection
      (f)
      (1) The amount of the annuity provided under subsection (f)(1) of
    this section (other than the last sentence thereof) for a survivor
    of a deceased individual shall be increased by an amount equal to
    the appropriate one of the following percentages of that portion of
    the annuity computed under section 231b(b) of this title, before
    any reduction on account of age and without regard to any reduction
    under section 231b(g)(2) of this title, to which such deceased
    individual would have been entitled for the month such survivor's
    annuity under section 231a(d) of this title began to accrue if such
    individual were living (deeming for this purpose that if such
    individual died before becoming entitled to an annuity under
    section 231a(a)(1) of this title, such individual became entitled
    to an annuity under subdivision (i) of such section 231a(a)(1) of
    this title in the month in which such individual died):
        (i) In the case of a widow or widower, the increase shall be
      equal to 50 per centum of such portion of the deceased
      individual's annuity, but the amount of the annuity so determined
      shall be subject to reduction on account of age in the same
      manner as is applicable to the annuity amount determined for the
      widow or widower under subsection (f) of this section and shall
      be subject to increase as provided in subdivision (4) of this
      subsection.
        (ii) In the case of a parent, the increase shall be equal to 35
      per centum of such portion of the deceased individual's annuity.
        (iii) In the case of a child, the increase shall be equal to 15
      per centum of such portion of the deceased individual's annuity.

      (2) Whenever the total amount of the increases based on the
    deceased individual's portion of the annuity under section 231b(b)
    of this title as determined under subdivision (1) of this
    subsection for all survivors of a deceased employee is - 
        (i) less than an amount equal to 35 per centum of such portion
      of the deceased individual's annuity, the total increase shall,
      before any deductions under section 231a(g) of this title, be
      increased proportionately until the total increase is equal to 35
      per centum of such portion of the deceased individual's annuity;
      or
        (ii) more than an amount equal to 80 per centum of such portion
      of the deceased individual's annuity, the total increase shall,
      before any deductions under section 231a(g) of this title and
      before any reduction on account of age, be reduced
      proportionately until the total increase is equal to 80 per
      centum of such portion of the deceased individual's annuity.

      (3) An annuity determined under this subsection for a month prior
    to the month in which application is filed, shall be reduced to any
    extent that may be necessary so that it will not render erroneous
    any annuity which, before the filing of such application, the Board
    has certified for payment for such prior month.
      (4) If a widow or widower of a deceased employee is entitled to
    an annuity under section 231a(a)(1) of this title and if either
    such widow or widower or such deceased employee will have completed
    10 years of service prior to January 1, 1975, the amount of the
    annuity of such widow or widower under subdivisions (1) through (3)
    of this subsection shall be increased by an amount equal to the
    amount, if any, by which (A) the widow's or widower's insurance
    annuity to which such widow or widower would have been entitled,
    upon attaining age 65, under section 5(a) of the Railroad
    Retirement Act of 1937 [45 U.S.C. 228e(a)] as in effect on December
    31, 1974 (without regard to the proviso of that section or the
    first proviso of section 3(e) of that Act [45 U.S.C. 228c(e)] on
    the basis of the deceased employee's remuneration and service prior
    to January 1, 1975, increased by the same percentage, or
    percentages, as widow's and widower's insurance benefits under
    section 202 of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 402] are
    increased during the period from January 1, 1975, to the later of
    the date on which such widow's or widower's annuity under section
    231a(a)(1) of this title began to accrue or the date on which such
    widow's or widower's annuity under section 231a(d)(1) of this title
    began to accrue, exceeds (B) the total of the annuity amounts to
    which such widow or widower was entitled (after any reductions
    pursuant to subsection (i)(2) of this section but before any
    deductions on account of work) under the preceding provisions of
    this subsection, subsection (f) of this section, and the amount
    determined under subsection (h) of this section, before the
    proviso, as of the later of the date on which such widow's or
    widower's annuity under section 231a(a)(1) of this title began to
    accrue or the date on which such widow's or widower's annuity under
    section 231a(d)(1) of this title began to accrue. If a widow or
    widower of a deceased employee is not entitled to an annuity under
    section 231a(a)(1) of this title or to an old-age insurance benefit
    or a disability insurance benefit under the Social Security Act [42
    U.S.C. 301 et seq.], the amount of the annuity to which such widow
    or widower is entitled under this subsection shall not be less than
    an amount which would cause the total of the annuity amounts to
    which such widow or widower is entitled (before any deductions on
    account of work) under this subsection and subsection (f)(1) of
    this section to equal the total of the annuity amounts to which
    such widow or widower was entitled (or would have been entitled
    except for the provisions of sections 231a(e) and 231a(f) of this
    title) as a spouse under subsections (a), (b), and (e) of this
    section (after any reduction on account of age) in the month
    preceding the employee's death. If a widow or widower of a deceased
    employee is entitled to an annuity under section 231a(a)(1) of this
    title or to an old-age insurance benefit or a disability insurance
    benefit under the Social Security Act, the amount of the annuity to
    which such widow or widower is entitled under this subsection shall
    not be less than an amount which would cause (A) the total of the
    annuity amounts to which such widow or widower is entitled (after
    any reductions pursuant to section 202(k) or 202(q) of the Social
    Security Act or subsection (i)(2) of this section but before any
    deductions on account of work) under this subsection and subsection
    (f) of this section to equal (B)(i) the total of the annuity
    amounts, if any, to which such widow or widower was entitled (or
    would have been entitled except for the provisions of sections
    231a(e) and 231a(f) of this title) as a spouse under subsections
    (a), (b), and (e) of this section (after any reduction on account
    of age) in the month preceding the employee's death less (ii), if
    such widow or widower is entitled to an old-age insurance benefit
    or a disability insurance benefit under the Social Security Act but
    was not entitled to such a benefit in the month preceding the
    employee's death, the amount by which the annuity amount payable
    under subsection (a) of this section to such widow or widower as a
    spouse in the month preceding the employee's death would have been
    reduced by reason of section 202(k) or 202(q) of the Social
    Security Act if such widow or widower had been entitled to an old-
    age insurance benefit or a disability insurance benefit under the
    Social Security Act in the month preceding the employee's death in
    an amount equal to the amount of such benefit at the time such
    benefit first began to accrue to such widow or widower.
      (5) This subsection shall not apply to the annuity of a widow,
    surviving divorced wife, or surviving divorced mother who is
    entitled to such annuity on the basis of the provisions of section
    231a(d)(1)(v) of this title.
      (6) That portion of the annuity of a survivor of an individual
    determined under subdivisions (1) and (2) of this subsection shall
    be increased whenever, and by the same percentage or percentages
    as, the annuity of the individual would have been increased
    pursuant to section 231b(g)(1) of this title if such individual
    were still living.
      (7) The first and, if necessary, the following time or times
    after January 1, 1983, that monthly insurance benefits under
    section 202 of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 402] are
    increased, that portion of the annuity of a survivor of a deceased
    individual as is determined under subdivisions (1) and (2) of this
    subsection, or under this subsection as in effect before amendment
    by section 1119(g) of Public Law 97-35, shall, if such survivor's
    annuity under section 231a(d) of this title began to accrue before
    the effective date of such first increase under the Social Security
    Act [42 U.S.C. 301 et seq.], be reduced by the dollar amount by
    which that portion of the annuity provided such survivor under
    subsection (f) of this section was increased, after any reduction
    under subsection (i) of this section, as a result of such increase
    or increases under the Social Security Act until the total dollar
    amount of such reduction or reductions equals 5 per centum of the
    annuity amount provided such survivor under subsection (f) of this
    section, as reduced under subsection (i) of this section, prior to
    such first increase. In no case shall the reduction by reason of
    this paragraph operate to reduce such portion to an amount less
    than $10.
      (8) That portion of the annuity of a survivor of a deceased
    individual as is determined under subdivisions (1) and (2) of this
    subsection shall, if the annuity of such survivor is not subject to
    reduction under subdivision (7) of this subsection, be reduced by
    an amount equal to the dollar amount by which the annuity of the
    deceased individual was reduced under section 231b(g)(2) of this
    title or would have been reduced under such section 231b(g)(2) of
    this title if such deceased individual had been living at the time
    such survivor's annuity under section 231a(d) of this title began
    to accrue (deeming for this purpose, if such individual died before
    becoming entitled to an annuity under section 231a(a)(1) of this
    title, that such individual became entitled to an annuity under
    paragraph (i) of such section 231a(a)(1) of this title in the month
    in which such individual died). In a case where the survivor of a
    deceased individual is not entitled to a monthly insurance benefit
    under the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 301 et seq.], the
    reduction provided by the preceding sentence of this subdivision
    shall be equal to the dollar amount by which the annuity of the
    deceased individual would have been reduced under section
    231b(g)(2) of this title if the annuity of such deceased individual
    had not been subject to reduction under section 231b(m) of this
    title. In no case shall the reduction by reason of this paragraph
    operate to reduce such portion to an amount less than $10.
      (9) That portion of the annuity of a survivor of a deceased
    individual as is determined under this subsection as in effect
    before amendment by section 1119(g) of Public Law 97-35 shall, if
    the annuity of such survivor is not subject to reduction under
    subdivision (7) of this subsection, be reduced by an amount equal
    to the dollar amount by which the annuity of the deceased
    individual was reduced under section 231b(g)(2) of this title or,
    if such survivor is not entitled to a monthly insurance benefit
    under the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 301 et seq.], would have
    been reduced under such section 231b(g)(2) of this title if the
    annuity of such deceased individual had not been subject to
    reduction under section 231b(m) of this title. In no case shall the
    reduction by reason of this paragraph operate to reduce such
    portion to an amount less than $10.
      (10)(i) If for any month the unreduced annuity provided under
    this section for a widow or widower is less than the widow's or
    widower's initial minimum amount computed pursuant to paragraph
    (ii) of this subdivision, the unreduced annuity shall be increased
    to that initial minimum amount. For the purposes of this
    subdivision, the unreduced annuity is the annuity without regard to
    any deduction on account of work, without regard to any reduction
    for entitlement to an annuity under section 231a(a)(1) of this
    title, without regard to any reduction for entitlement to a benefit
    under title II of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 401 et seq.],
    and without regard to any reduction for entitlement to a public
    service pension pursuant to section 202(e)(7), 202(f)(2), or
    202(g)(4) of the Social Security Act.(!5)

      (ii) For the purposes of this subdivision, the widow or widower's
    initial minimum amount is the amount of the unreduced annuity
    computed at the time an annuity is awarded to that widow or
    widower, except that - 
        (A) in subsection (g)(1)(i) of this section "100 per centum"
      shall be substituted for "50 per centum"; and
        (B) in subsection (g)(2)(ii) of this section "130 per centum"
      shall be substituted for "80 per centum" both places it appears.

      (iii) If a widow or widower who was previously entitled to a
    widow's or widower's annuity under section 231a(d)(1)(ii) of this
    title becomes entitled to a widow's or widower's annuity under
    section 231a(d)(1)(i) of this title, a new initial minimum amount
    shall be computed at the time of award of the widow's or widower's
    annuity under section 231a(d)(1)(i) of this title.
    (h) Increases in particular widows' and widowers' annuities
      (1) The amount of the annuity of the widow or widower of a
    deceased employee determined under subsections (f) and (g) of this
    section, if such deceased employee will have completed ten years of
    service prior to January 1, 1975, and such widow or widower will
    have been permanently insured under the Social Security Act [42
    U.S.C. 301 et seq.] of (!6) December 31, 1974, shall be increased
    by an amount equal to the amount, if any, by which (A) the widow's
    or widower's insurance annuity to which such widow or widower would
    have been entitled, upon attaining age 65, under section 5(a) of
    the Railroad Retirement Act of 1937 [45 U.S.C. 228e(a)] as in
    effect on December 31, 1974 (without regard to the proviso of that
    section or the first proviso of section 3(e) of that Act [45 U.S.C.
    228c(e)]), on the basis of the deceased employee's remuneration and
    service prior to January 1, 1975, increased by the same percentage,
    or percentages, as widow's and widower's insurance benefits under
    section 202 of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 402] are
    increased during the period from January 1, 1975, to January 1,
    1982 or, if earlier, to the later of the date on which such widow's
    or widower's annuity under section 231a(d)(1) of this title began
    to accrue or the date beginning the first month for which such
    widow or widower is entitled to an old age insurance benefit or
    disability insurance benefit under the Social Security Act, exceeds
    (B) the total of the annuity amounts to which such widow or widower
    was entitled (after any reductions pursuant to section 202(k) or
    202(q) of the Social Security Act and subsection (i)(2) of this
    section but before any deductions on account of work) under
    subsections (f) and (g) of this section as to the later of the date
    on which such widow's or widower's annuity under section 231a(d)(1)
    of this title began to accrue or the date beginning the first month
    for which such widow or widower is entitled to an old-age insurance
    benefit or disability insurance benefit under the Social Security
    Act: Provided, however, That, if a widow or widower was entitled
    (or would have been entitled except for the provisions of section
    231a(e) or 231a(f) of this title) to an annuity amount under
    subdivision (1) or (2) of subsection (e) of this section in the
    month preceding the employee's death, the amount of the annuity to
    which such widow or widower is entitled under this subsection shall
    not be less than an amount which would cause (A) the total of the
    annuity amounts to which such widow or widower is entitled (after
    any reductions pursuant to section 202(k) or 202(q) of the Social
    Security Act but before any deductions on account of work) under
    subsections (f) and (g) of this section and the preceding
    provisions of this subsection as of the date such widow's or
    widower's annuity under section 231a(d)(1) of this title began to
    accrue to equal (B) the total of the annuity amounts to which such
    widow or widower was entitled (or would have been entitled except
    for the provisions of section 231a(e) or 231a(f) of this title) as
    a spouse under subsections (a), (b), and (e) of this section (after
    any reductions on account of age) in the month preceding the
    employee's death.

      (2) Subdivision (1) of this subsection shall not apply to the
    annuity of a widow, surviving divorced wife, or surviving divorced
    mother who is entitled to such annuity on the basis of the
    provisions of section 231a(d)(1)(v) of this title. No amount shall
    be payable to a person under subdivision (1) of this subsection
    unless the entitlement of such person to such amount had been
    determined prior to August 13, 1981.
    (i) Reductions in survivors' annuities
      (1) The annuity of any spouse or divorced wife under subsection
    (a) of this section for any month shall, after a reduction pursuant
    to section 231a(c)(2) of this title be reduced, but not below zero,
    by the amount of any insurance benefit (before any deduction on
    account of work) payable to such spouse or divorced wife for that
    month under title II of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 401 et
    seq.].
      (2) If a spouse or divorced wife entitled to an annuity under
    section 231a(c) of this title or a survivor entitled to an annuity
    under section 231a(d) of this title for any month is also entitled
    to an annuity under section 231a(a)(1) of this title for such
    month, the annuity amount of such spouse or divorced wife
    determined under subsection (a) of this section or of such survivor
    under subsection (f) of this section shall, after any reduction
    pursuant to subdivision (1) of this subsection, be reduced by the
    amount of the annuity of such spouse or divorced wife or such
    survivor determined under section 231b(a) of this title.
      (3) The annuity of any survivor under subsection (f) of this
    section shall be reduced, but not below zero, by the amount of any
    insurance benefit (before any deduction on account of work) payable
    to such survivor under title II of the Social Security Act [42
    U.S.C. 401 et seq.], unless in computing the amount under
    subsection (f) of this section a reduction was made for such
    insurance benefit pursuant to section 202(k) of the Social Security
    Act [42 U.S.C. 402(k)].

    Sec. 231d. Annuity beginning and ending dates

-STATUTE-
    (a) Annuities under section 231a of this title
      Subject to the limitations set forth below, an annuity under
    section 231a of this title shall begin with the month in which
    eligibility therefor was otherwise acquired, but - 
        (i) not earlier than the date specified in the application
      therefor;
        (ii) in the case of an applicant otherwise entitled to an
      annuity under paragraph (iv) or (v) of section 231a(a)(1) of this
      title or under section 231a(d)(1)(i) of this title on the basis
      of disability, not earlier than the later of (A) the first day of
      the sixth month following the onset date of the disability for
      which such annuity is awarded or (B) the first day of the twelfth
      month before the month in which the application therefor was
      filed;
        (iii) in the case of an applicant otherwise entitled to an
      annuity under section 231a(a)(1), 231a(c), or 231a(d) of this
      title where paragraph (ii) does not apply, not earlier than the
      latest of (A) the first day of the sixth month before the month
      in which the application therefor was filed, (B) the first day of
      the month in which the application therefor was filed if the
      effect of beginning such annuity in an earlier month would result
      in a greater age reduction in the annuity, unless beginning the
      annuity in the earlier month would enable an annuity under
      section 231a(c) of this title which is not subject to an age
      reduction to be payable in such earlier month, (C) in the case of
      an applicant otherwise entitled to an annuity under section
      231a(a)(1) or 231a(c) of this title, the date following the last
      day of compensated service of the applicant, or (D) in the case
      of an applicant otherwise entitled to an annuity under section
      231a(a)(1) or 231a(c) of this title, the first day of the first
      month throughout which the applicant meets the age requirement
      for the annuity applied for;
        (iv) in the case of an applicant otherwise entitled to an
      annuity under section 231a(c)(4) or (d)(1)(v) of this title, not
      earlier than the month an annuity would begin to accrue to such
      individual under such section if section 202(j)(1) and section
      202(j)(4) of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 402(j)(1), (4)]
      were applicable to this subchapter.(!1)

        (v) an annuity amount provided by section 231b(h)(1) or
      231b(h)(2) of this title shall not be paid to an individual
      otherwise eligible therefor for any month before the month such
      individual would be entitled, upon filing an application
      therefor, to an old-age insurance benefit or a disability
      insurance benefit under title II of the Social Security Act [42
      U.S.C. 401 et seq.] and an annuity amount provided by section
      231b(h)(3) or section 231b(h)(4) of this title shall not be paid
      to an individual otherwise eligible therefor for any month before
      the month such individual would be entitled, upon filing an
      application therefore,(!2) to an insurance benefit as a wife,
      husband, widow, or widower under title II of the Social Security
      Act;

        (vi) an annuity amount provided by section 231c(e)(1) or
      231c(e)(2) of this title shall not be paid to a spouse otherwise
      eligible therefor for any month prior to the month such spouse
      would be entitled, upon filing an application therefor, to an old-
      age or disability insurance benefit under title II of the Social
      Security Act [42 U.S.C. 401 et seq.]; and
        (vii) an annuity amount provided by section 231c(e)(3) of this
      title shall not be paid to a spouse otherwise eligible therefor
      for any month prior to the month such spouse would be entitled,
      upon filing an application therefor, to a wife's or husband's
      insurance benefit under title II of the Social Security Act [42
      U.S.C. 401 et seq.].

    For the purpose of determining annuity amounts provided under
    sections 231b(a), 231c(a), and 231c(f) of this title, the
    provisions with respect to the beginning dates of annuities set
    forth in this subsection shall be deemed to govern the beginning
    dates of monthly benefits provided under the Social Security Act
    [42 U.S.C. 301 et seq.].
    (b) Applications for payment
      An application for any payment under this subchapter shall be

    section 202(a), section 202(b), or section 202(c) of the Social
    Security Act [42 U.S.C. 402(a), (b), (c)]. An application filed
    with the Board for an annuity on the basis of the employment record
    of an employee who will have completed ten years of service shall,
    unless the applicant specified otherwise, be deemed to be an
    application for any benefit to which such applicant may be entitled
    under this subchapter or title II of the Social Security Act [42
    U.S.C. 401 et seq.]. An individual who was entitled to an annuity

    entitled to an annuity under section 231a(d)(1) of this title on

    application for an annuity under such section 231a(d)(1) of this
    title on the basis of age on the date on which she or he attained
    age 60.

    this title (other than a wife who is receiving such annuity by
    reason of an election under section 231a(c)(2) of this title), such
    wife no longer has in her care a child described in clause (ii)(C)
    of section 231a(c)(1) of this title, whichever first occurs. The

    terminated by reason of clause (E) of this subdivision because he
    or she ceased to be disabled and who again becomes disabled as
    provided in clause (C) of such paragraph (iii), may become
    reentitled to an annuity on the basis of such disability upon his
    or her application for such reentitlement. A child whose
    entitlement to an annuity under paragraph (iii) of section
    231a(d)(1) of this title terminated with the month preceding the
    month in which he or she attained age 18, or with a subsequent
    month, may again become entitled to such an annuity (providing no
    event to disqualify the child has occurred) beginning with the
    first month thereafter in which he or she meets the qualifications
    set forth in clause (B) or (C) of such paragraph (iii), if he or
    she has filed an application for such reentitlement.

    shall end on the last day of the month preceding the month in which
    (A) such parent dies or (B) such parent remarries after the
    employee's death, whichever first occurs.
      (9) No annuity shall accrue with respect to the calendar month in
    which an annuitant dies. In cases where an individual entitled to
    an annuity under this subchapter disappears, no annuity shall
    accrue to that individual with respect to any month until and
    unless such individual is shown, by evidence satisfactory to the
    Board, to have continued in life throughout such month, but - 
        (A) where an annuity would accrue for such month under section
      231a(a)(1) of this title to an individual who had a current
      connection with the railroad industry at the time of such
      individual's disappearance, and under section 231a(c) of this
      title to such individual's spouse, had such individual been shown
      to be alive during such month, such individual shall be deemed,
      for the purposes of benefits under section 231a(d) of this title,
      to have died in the month in which such individual disappeared,
      and where an annuity would accrue for such month under section
      231a(a)(1) of this title to an individual who did not have a
      current connection with the railroad industry at the time of such
      individual's disappearance, and under section 231a(c) of this
      title to such individual's spouse, had such individual been shown
      to be alive during such month, such individual shall be deemed,
      for purposes of benefits payable under section 231a(c) of this
      title, to be alive during such month unless the death of such
      individual has been established or the annuity of the spouse of
      such individual is otherwise terminated under subsection (c)(3)
      of this section, and
        (B) if such individual is later determined to have been alive
      during any of such months, recovery of any benefits paid on the
      basis of such individual's compensation under section 231a(d) of
      this title for the months in which such individual was not known
      to be alive, minus the total of the amounts that would have been
      paid as a spouse's annuity during such months (treating the
      application for a widow's or widower's annuity as an application
      for spouse's annuity), shall be made in accordance with section
      231l of this title.

    For purposes of the payment of benefits under this subchapter, the
    death of an individual shall be presumed based on such individual's
    unexplained absence of not less than seven years, except that
    whenever the death of an individual is so established, such
    individual shall be deemed to have died in the month in which such
    individual disappeared.

    property settlement incident to any such court decree shall not be

    Sec. 231e. Lump sum payments

-STATUTE-
    (a) Eligible annuities; applications; reversion; determination of
      status of recipient
      (1) Annuities under section 231a(a)(1) of this title and
    supplemental annuities under section 231a(b) of this title which
    will have become due an individual but will not have been paid at
    the time of such individual's death shall be payable to the person,
    if any, who is determined by the Board to be such individual's
    widow or widower and to have been living with such individual at
    the time of such individual's death and who will not have died
    before receiving payment of such annuities. If there be no such
    widow or widower, such annuities shall be payable to any person or
    persons, equitably entitled thereto, to the extent and in the
    proportions that he or they shall have paid the expenses of burial
    of such individual, and to the extent that he or they will not have
    been reimbursed under subsection (b) of this section for having
    paid such expenses. If there be no person or persons so entitled,
    or if the total of such annuities exceeds the amount payable under
    this subdivision to such person or persons, such total, or the
    remainder thereof, as the case may be, shall be paid to the
    children, grandchildren, parents, or brothers and sisters of the
    deceased individual in the same manner as if such annuities were a
    lump sum payable under subsection (c)(1) of this section.
      (2) Annuities under section 231a(d) of this title which will have
    become due a survivor of an employee but will not have been paid at
    the time of such survivor's death shall be payable to the person,
    if any, who is determined by the Board to be such employee's widow
    or widower and to have been living with such employee at the time
    of the employee's death and who will not have died before receiving
    payment of such annuities. If there be no such widow or widower,
    such annuities shall be payable to the children, grandchildren,
    parents, or brothers and sisters of the deceased employee in the
    same manner as if such unpaid annuities were a lump sum payable
    under subsection (c)(1) of this section.
      (3) Annuities under section 231a(c) of this title which will have
    become due a spouse or divorced wife of an individual but which
    will not have been paid at the time of such spouse's or divorced
    wife's death shall be payable to the individual from whose
    employment such annuities derived and who will not have died before
    receiving payment of such annuities. If there be no such
    individual, such annuities shall be paid as provided in the last
    two sentences of subdivision (1) of this subsection as if such
    annuities were annuities due to an individual but unpaid at the
    time of such individual's death.
      (4) Applications for accrued and unpaid annuities provided for in
    the preceding subdivisions of this subsection shall be filed prior
    to the expiration of two years after the death of the person to
    whom such annuities were originally due.
      (5) If there is no person to whom all or any part of the payments
    described in subdivision (1), (2), or (3) can be made, such payment
    or part thereof shall escheat to the credit of the Railroad
    Retirement Account.
      (6) For the purposes of this subsection and subsection (c) of
    this section, a widow or widower of an individual shall be deemed
    to have been living with the individual at the time of the
    individual's death if the applicable conditions set forth in
    section 216(h)(2) or (3) of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C.
    416(h)(2) or (3)], as in effect before 1957, are fulfilled.
      (7) In determining for purposes of this subsection and
    subsections (c) and (d) of this section whether an applicant is the
    widow, widower, child, or parent of an employee as claimed, the
    rules set forth in section 216(h) of the Social Security Act [42
    U.S.C. 416(h)] shall be applied. In determining for purposes of
    this subsection and subsections (c) and (d) of this section whether
    an applicant is the grandchild, brother, or sister of an employee
    as claimed, the Board shall apply such law as would be applied in
    determining the devolution of intestate personal property by the
    courts of the State in which such employee was domiciled at the
    time of his death, or if such employee was not so domiciled in any
    State by the courts of the District of Columbia. Applicants who
    according to such law would have the same status relative to taking
    personal property as a grandchild, brother, or sister shall be
    deemed such.
    (b) Payments in accordance with Railroad Retirement Act of 1937 and
      Social Security Act
      (1) Upon the death of an individual who will have completed ten
    years of service prior to January 1, 1975, and will have had a
    current connection with the railroad industry at the time of his
    death, a lump-sum payment shall be made in accordance with the
    provisions of section 5(f)(1) of the Railroad Retirement Act of
    1937 [45 U.S.C. 228e(f)(1)] as in effect on December 31, 1974, in
    an amount, if any, which would have been payable under such section
    on the basis of (A) the individual's compensation after December
    31, 1936, and prior to January 1, 1975, and (B) the individual's
    wages (as defined in section 209 of the Social Security Act [42
    U.S.C. 409]) prior to January 1, 1975. Any lump sum payable under
    this subdivision shall be in an amount computed as if the
    individual had died on January 1, 1975. No lump sum shall be
    payable under this subdivision if the employee died leaving a
    surviving divorced wife who would on proper application therefore
    be entitled to receive an annuity under section 231a(d) of this
    title for the month in which the employee's death occurred.
      (2) Upon the death of an individual who will not have completed
    ten years of service prior to January 1, 1975, but who (i) will
    have completed ten years of service (or five or more years of
    service, all of which accrues after December 31, 1995) at the time
    of his death, (ii) will have had a current connection with the
    railroad industry at the time of his death, and (iii) will have
    died leaving no widow, surviving divorced wife, widower, child, or
    parent who would on proper application therefor be entitled to
    receive an annuity under section 231a(d) of this title for the
    month in which such death occurred, a lump-sum death payment shall
    be made in accordance with the provisions of section 202(i) of the
    Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 402(i)] in an amount equal to the
    amount which would have been payable under such section 202(i) if
    such individual's service as an employee after December 31, 1936,
    were included in the term "employment" as defined in that Act. If a
    lump sum would be payable to a widow or widower under this
    subdivision except for the fact that a survivor will have been
    entitled to receive an annuity for the month in which the
    individual will have died, but within one year after the
    individual's death there will not have accrued to survivors of the
    individual, by reason of his death, annuities which, after all
    deductions pursuant to section 231a(g) and 231a(h) of this title,
    are equal to such lump sum, a payment equal to the amount by which
    such lump sum exceeds such annuities so accrued after such
    deductions shall then nevertheless be made under this subdivision
    to the widow or widower to whom a lump sum would have been payable
    under this subdivision except for the fact that a monthly benefit
    under section 231a(d) of this title was payable for the month in
    which the individual died, if such widow or widower will not have
    died before receiving payment of such lump sum.
    (c) Payments in the absence of further benefits
      (1) Whenever it shall appear, with respect to the death of an
    employee, that no benefits, or no further benefits (other than
    benefits payable to a widow, widower, or parent under either this
    subchapter or the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 301 et seq.] upon
    attaining the age of eligibility therefor at a future date) will be
    payable under this subchapter or under the Social Security Act, a
    lump sum in an amount computed under subdivision (2) of this
    subsection shall be paid to such person or persons as the deceased
    employee may have designated by a writing filed with the Board
    prior to his or her death, or if there be no designation, to the
    following person (or, if more than one, in equal shares to the
    persons) whose relationship to the deceased employee will have been
    determined by the Board and who will not have died before receiving
    payment of the lump sum provided for in this subdivision - 
        (i) the widow or widower of the deceased employee who was
      living with such employee at the time of such employee's death;
      or
        (ii) if there be no such widow or widower, to any child or
      children of such employee; or
        (iii) if there be no such widow, widower, or child, to any
      grandchild or grandchildren of such employee; or
        (iv) if there be no such widow, widower, child, or grandchild,
      to any parent or parents of such employee; or
        (v) if there be no such widow, widower, child, grandchild, or
      parent, to any brother or sister of such employee; or
        (vi) if there be no such widow, widower, child, grandchild,
      parent, brother, or sister, to the estate of such employee:

    Provided, however, That if the employee is survived by a widow,
    widower, or parent who may upon attaining the age of eligibility be
    entitled to benefits under this subchapter or under the Social
    Security Act, such lump sum shall not be paid unless such widow,
    widower, or parent makes and files with the Board an irrevocable
    election, in such form as the Board may prescribe, to have such
    lump sum be paid in lieu of all benefits to which such widow,
    widower, or parent might otherwise become entitled under this
    subchapter on the basis of the deceased employee's compensation and
    years of service or under the Social Security Act on the basis of
    the deceased employee's wages from (A) employment with an employer
    as defined in section 231(a) of this title or (B) service as an
    employee representative as defined in section 231(c) of this title.
    Any election made and filed by a widow, widower, or parent pursuant
    to this subdivision shall be legally effective according to its
    terms. After a lump sum with respect to the death of an employee is
    paid pursuant to an election filed with the Board under the
    provisions of this subsection, no further benefits shall be paid
    (other than to a survivor in the circumstances described in
    paragraph (3)) under this subchapter or the Social Security Act on
    the basis of such employee's compensation and service under this
    subchapter, except that nothing in this subchapter or the Social
    Security Act shall operate to deprive a widow, widower, or parent
    making such election of any insurance benefit under title II of the
    Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 401 et seq.] to which such
    individual would have been entitled if the employee had not
    rendered service as an employee under this subchapter.
      (2) The lump sum provided under subdivision (1) of this
    subsection shall be in an amount equal to (A) the sum of 4 per
    centum of the deceased employee's compensation paid after December
    31, 1936, and prior to January 1, 1947, plus 7 per centum of such
    employee's compensation paid after December 31, 1946, and before
    January 1, 1959, plus 7 1/2  per centum of such employee's
    compensation paid after December 31, 1958, and before January 1,
    1962, plus 8 per centum of such employee's compensation paid after
    December 31, 1961, and before January 1, 1966, plus an amount equal
    to the total of all employee taxes payable by such employee after
    December 31, 1965, and before January 1, 1975, under the provisions
    of section 3201 of the Railroad Retirement Tax Act [26 U.S.C. 3201]
    (excluding, for this purpose, the amount of the employee tax
    attributable to that portion of the tax rate derived from section
    3101(b) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 [26 U.S.C. 3101(b)]),
    plus one-half of 1 per centum of the compensation on which such
    taxes were payable, deeming the compensation attributable to
    creditable military service after June 30, 1963, and before January
    1, 1975, to be taxable compensation, and one-half of the taxes
    payable by an employee representative under section 3211 of the
    Railroad Retirement Tax Act [26 U.S.C. 3211] to be employee taxes
    under section 3201 of such Act, minus (B) the sum of all benefits
    paid to such employee, and to others deriving from such employee,
    during his or her life, or to others by reason of his or her death,
    under this subchapter, the Railroad Retirement Act of 1937 [45
    U.S.C. 228a et seq.], or the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 301 et
    seq.] (excluding, for this purpose, payments to providers of
    services under section 231f(d) of this title or section 21 of the
    Railroad Retirement Act of 1937 [45 U.S.C. 228s-2], any
    supplemental annuity payments made to the employee under section
    231a(b) of this title or section 3(j) of the Railroad Retirement
    Act of 1937 [45 U.S.C. 228c(j)], any amounts by which that portion
    of the annuities provided the employee under section 231b(a) of
    this title or his spouse or divorced wife under section 231c(a) of
    this title were increased by reason of the employee's wages and
    self-employment income derived from employment and self-employment
    under the Social Security Act, that portion of the annuities
    provided the employee under section 231b(h) of this title or his
    spouse under section 231c(e) of this title, and so much of the
    benefits paid to the employee and to others deriving from him or
    her under the Social Security Act during his or her lifetime as
    would have been payable under that Act if such employee had not
    rendered service as an employee as defined in section 231(b) of
    this title). In computing compensation for purposes of this
    subdivision there shall be excluded compensation in excess of $300
    for any month before July 1, 1954; compensation in excess of $350
    for any month after June 30, 1954, and before June 1, 1959;
    compensation in excess of $400 for any month after May 31, 1959,
    and before November 1, 1963; compensation in excess of $450 for any
    month after October 31, 1963, and before October 1, 1965; and
    compensation in excess of (i) $450 or (ii) an amount equal to one-
    twelfth of the current maximum annual taxable "wages" as defined
    in section 3121 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 [26 U.S.C.
    3121], whichever is greater, for any month after September 30,
    1965.
      (3) Notwithstanding the last sentence of paragraph (1), benefits
    shall be paid to a survivor who - 
        (A) is a divorced wife; and
        (B) through administrative error received benefits otherwise
      precluded by the making of a lump sum payment under this section
      to a widow;

    if that divorced wife makes an election to repay to the Board the
    lump sum payment. The Board may withhold up to 10 percent of each
    benefit amount paid after October 21, 1998, toward such
    reimbursement. The Board may waive such repayment to the extent the
    Board determines it would cause an unjust financial hardship for
    the beneficiary.
    (d) Payments to recipients ineligible for certain other annuities
      (1) Every individual who will have completed ten years of service
    at the time of his retirement or death, but does not meet the
    qualifications for an annuity amount determined under the
    provisions of section 231b(h)(1) or 231b(h)(2) of this title,
    shall, at the time his annuity under section 231a(a)(1) of this
    title begins to accrue, be entitled to a lump sum in the amount
    provided under subdivision (2) of this subsection. If an individual
    otherwise eligible for a lump sum under this section dies before he
    becomes entitled to an annuity under section 231a(a)(1) of this
    title, or before he receives payment of such lump sum, such lump
    sum shall be payable to the person, if any, who is determined by
    the Board to be such individual's widow or widower and who will not
    have died before receiving payment of such lump sum. If there be no
    such widow or widower, such lump sum shall be payable to the
    children, grandchildren, parents, brothers and sisters, or the
    estate of the deceased individual in the same manner as if such
    lump sum were a lump sum payable under subsection (c)(1) of this
    section.
      (2) The lump sum provided under subdivision (1) of this
    subsection shall be in an amount equal to the sum of (A) 1.5 per
    centum of so much of such individual's combined earnings for any
    calendar year after 1950 and before 1954 as is in excess of $3,600,
    plus (B) 2 per centum of so much of such individual's combined
    earnings for any calendar year after 1953 and before 1957 as is in
    excess of $4,200, plus (C) 2.25 per centum of so much of such
    individual's combined earnings for any calendar year after 1956 and
    before 1959 as is in excess of $4,200, plus (D) 2.5 per centum of
    so much of such individual's combined earnings for the calendar
    year 1959 as is in excess of $4,800, plus (E) 3 per centum of so
    much of such individual's combined earnings for each of the
    calendar years 1960 and 1961 as is in excess of $4,800, plus (F)
    3.125 per centum of so much of such individual's combined earnings
    for the calendar year 1962 as is in excess of $4,800, plus (G)
    3.625 per centum of so much of such individual's combined earnings
    for any calendar year after 1962 and before 1966 as is in excess of
    $5,400, plus (H) 4.2 per centum of so much of such individual's
    combined earnings for the calendar year 1966 as is in excess of
    $6,600, plus (I) 4.4 per centum of so much of such individual's
    combined earnings for the calendar year 1967 as is in excess of
    $6,600, plus (J) 3.8 per centum of so much of such individual's
    combined earnings for the calendar year 1968 as is in excess of
    $7,800, plus (K) 4.2 per centum of so much of such individual's
    combined earnings for each of the calendar years 1969 and 1970 as
    is in excess of $7,800, plus (L) 4.6 per centum of so much of such
    individual's combined earnings for the calendar year 1971 as is in
    excess of $7,800, plus (M) 4.6 per centum of so much of such
    individual's combined earnings for the calendar year 1972 as is in
    excess of $9,000, plus (N) 4.85 per centum of so much of such
    individual's combined earnings for the calendar year 1973 as is in
    excess of $10,800, plus (O) 4.95 per centum of so much of such
    individual's combined earnings for the calendar year 1974 as is in
    excess of $13,200. For purposes of this subsection, the term
    "combined earnings" shall include "compensation" as defined in
    section 1(h) of the Railroad Retirement Act of 1937 [45 U.S.C.
    228a(h)], "wages" as defined in section 209 of the Social Security
    Act [42 U.S.C. 409], and "self-employment" income as defined in
    section 211(b) of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 411(b)].
    (e) Additional lump sum payment in certain cases
      (1) Every individual who will have completed ten years of service
    (or five or more years of service, all of which accrues after
    December 31, 1995) at the time of his retirement or death, who will
    have received compensation in the nature of separation or severance
    pay on or after January 1, 1985, and who would have been credited
    with additional months of service pursuant to section 231b(i)(4) of
    this title except for the fact that such individual was not in an
    employment relation to one or more employers nor an employee
    representative in such months, shall, at the time his annuity under
    section 231a(a)(1) of this title begins to accrue, be entitled to a
    lump sum in the amount provided under subdivision (2) of this
    subsection. If the full amount of a lump sum under this subsection
    cannot be determined at the time an individual's annuity under
    section 231a(a)(1) of this title begins to accrue, such lump sum
    shall be payable at such time thereafter as such amount can be
    determined. If an individual otherwise eligible for a lump sum
    under this section dies before he becomes entitled to an annuity
    under section 231a(a)(1) of this title, or before he receives
    payment of such lump sum, such lump sum shall be payable to the
    person, if any, who is determined by the Board to be such
    individual's widow or widower and who will not have died before
    receiving payment of such lump sum. If there be no such widow or
    widower, such lump sum shall be payable to the children,
    grandchildren, parents, brothers and sisters, or the estate of the
    deceased individual in the same manner as if such lump sum were a
    lump sum payable under subsection (c)(1) of this section.
      (2) The lump sum provided under subdivision (l) (!1) of this
    subsection shall be in an amount equal to the product of (A) the
    compensation attributable to the additional months of service which
    would have been credited to the individual due to the receipt of
    payments in the nature of separation or severance pay pursuant to
    section 231b(i)(4) of this title if such individual had remained in
    an employment relation to one or more employers or had continued to
    be an employee representative and (B) the rate of tax, or rates of
    tax, imposed on the compensation described in clause (A) of this
    subdivision by section 3201(b) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986
    [26 U.S.C. 3201(b)].

    Sec. 231f. Railroad Retirement Board

-STATUTE-
    (a) Administration
      This subchapter shall be administered by the Railroad Retirement
    Board established by the Railroad Retirement Act of 1937 [45 U.S.C.
    228a et seq.] as an independent agency in the executive branch of
    the Government and composed of three members appointed by the
    President, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate. Each
    member shall hold office for a term of five years, except that any
    member appointed to fill a vacancy occurring prior to the
    expiration of the term for which his predecessor was appointed
    shall be appointed for the remainder of the term and any member
    holding office pursuant to appointment under the Railroad
    Retirement Act of 1937 when this subchapter becomes effective shall
    hold office until the term for which he was appointed under such
    Railroad Retirement Act of 1937 expires. One member shall be
    appointed from recommendations made by representatives of the
    employees and one member shall be appointed from recommendations
    made by representatives of employers as defined in paragraph (i) of
    section 231(a)(1) of this title, in both cases as the President
    shall direct, so as to provide representation on the Board
    satisfactory to the largest number, respectively, of employees and
    employers concerned. One member, who shall be the chairman of the
    Board, shall be appointed without recommendation by either
    employers or employees and shall not be in the employment of or be
    pecuniarily or otherwise interested in any employer or organization
    of employees. Vacancies in the Board shall not impair the powers or
    affect the duties of the Board or of the remaining members of the
    Board, of whom a majority of those in office shall constitute a
    quorum for the transaction of business. Upon the expiration of his
    term of office a member shall continue to serve until his successor
    is appointed and shall have qualified.
    (b) Powers and duties
      (1) The Board shall have and exercise all the duties and powers
    necessary to administer this subchapter. The Board shall take such
    steps as may be necessary to enforce such subchapter and make
    awards and certify payments. Decisions by the Board upon issues of
    law and fact relating to annuities or death benefits shall not be
    subject to review by any other administrative or accounting
    officer, agent, or employee of the United States.
      (2) In the case of - 
        (A) an individual who will have completed ten years of service
      (or five or more years of service, all of which accrues after
      December 31, 1995) creditable under this subchapter,
        (B) the wife or divorced wife or husband of such an individual,
        (C) any survivor of such an individual if such survivor is
      entitled, or could upon application become entitled, to an
      annuity under section 231a of this title, and
        (D) any other person entitled to benefits under title II of the
      Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 401 et seq.] on the basis of the
      wages and self-employment income of such an individual (except a
      survivor of such an individual where such individual did not have
      a current connection with the railroad industry at the time of
      his death);

    the Board shall provide for the payment on behalf of the Managing
    Trustee of the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund
    and the Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund of monthly benefits
    payable under title II of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 401 et
    seq.] which are certified by the Secretary to it for payment under
    the provisions of title II of the Social Security Act.
      (3) If the Board finds that an applicant is entitled to an
    annuity or death benefit under the provisions of this subchapter
    then the Board shall make an award fixing the amount of the annuity
    or benefit, as the case may be, and shall certify the payment
    thereof as hereinafter provided; otherwise the application shall be
    denied. For purposes of this section, the Board shall have and
    exercise such of the powers, duties and remedies provided in
    subsections (a), (b), (d), and (n) of section 12 of the Railroad
    Unemployment Insurance Act [45 U.S.C. 362] as are not inconsistent
    with the express provisions of this subchapter. The Board is
    authorized to delegate to any member, officer, or employee of the
    Board any of the powers conferred upon the Board by this
    subchapter, excluding only the power to prescribe rules and
    regulations, including the power to make decisions on applications
    for annuities or other benefits: Provided, however, That any person
    aggrieved by a decision on his application for an annuity or other
    benefit shall have the right to appeal to the Board. Notice of a
    decision of the Board, or of an employee thereof, shall be
    communicated to the applicant in writing within thirty days after
    such decision shall have been made.
      (4)(A) The Secretary of the Treasury shall serve as the
    disbursing agent for benefits payable under this subchapter, under
    such rules and regulations as the Secretary may in the Secretary's
    discretion prescribe.
      (B) The Board shall from time to time certify - 
        (i) to the Secretary of the Treasury the amounts required to be
      transferred from the Social Security Equivalent Benefit Account
      and the Dual Benefits Payments Account to the disbursing agent to
      make payments of benefits and the Secretary of the Treasury shall
      transfer those amounts;
        (ii) to the Board of Trustees of the National Railroad
      Retirement Investment Trust the amounts required to be
      transferred from the National Railroad Retirement Investment
      Trust to the disbursing agent to make payments of benefits and
      the Board of Trustees shall transfer those amounts; and
        (iii) to the disbursing agent the name and address of each
      individual entitled to receive a payment, the amount of such
      payment, and the time at which the payment should be made.

      (5) The Board shall establish and promulgate rules and
    regulations to provide for the adjustment of all controversial
    matters arising in the administration of this subchapter. All
    rules, regulations, or decisions of the Board shall require the
    approval of at least two members, and they shall be entered upon
    the records of the Board, which shall be a public record.
      (6) The Board shall gather, keep, compile, and publish in
    convenient form such records and data as may be necessary to assure
    proper administration of this subchapter, including subdivision (2)
    of this subsection. The Board shall have power to require all
    employers and employees and any officer, board, commission, or
    other agency of the United States to furnish such information and
    records as shall be necessary for the administration of this
    subchapter, including subdivision (2) of this subsection. The
    several district courts of the United States shall have
    jurisdiction upon suit by the Board to compel obedience to any
    order of the Board issued pursuant to this section. The orders,
    writs, and processes of the United States District Court for the
    District of Columbia in such suits may run and be served anywhere
    in the United States. Witnesses summoned before the Board shall be
    paid the same fees and mileage that are paid witnesses in the
    district courts of the United States. The Board shall make an
    annual report to the President of the United States to be submitted
    to Congress.
      (7) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Secretary of
    Health and Human Services shall furnish the Board certified reports
    of wages, self-employment income, and periods of service and of
    other records in his possession, or which he may secure, pertinent
    to the administration of this subchapter, the Railroad Unemployment
    Insurance Act [45 U.S.C. 351 et seq.],,(!1) the Milwaukee Railroad
    Restructuring Act [45 U.S.C. 901 et seq.], and the Rock Island
    Railroad Transition and Employee Assistance Act [45 U.S.C. 1001 et
    seq.]..(!1) The Board shall furnish the Secretary of Health and
    Human Services certified reports of records of compensation and
    periods of service reported to it pursuant to section 231h of this
    title, of determinations under section 231a of this title, and of
    other records in its possession, or which it may secure, pertinent
    to subsection (c) of this section or to the administration of the
    Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 301 et seq.] as affected by section
    231q of this title. Such certified reports shall be conclusive in
    adjudication as to the matters covered therein: Provided, however,
    That if the Board or the Secretary of Health and Human Services
    receives evidence inconsistent with a certified report and the
    application involved is still in course of adjudication or
    otherwise open for such evidence such recertification of such
    report shall be made as, in the judgment of the Board or the
    Secretary of Health and Human Services, whichever made the original
    certification, the evidence warrants. Such recertification and any
    subsequent recertification shall be treated in the same manner and
    be subject to the same conditions as an original certification.

      (8) Any department or agency of the United States maintaining
    records of military service, at the request of the Board, shall
    certify to the Board, with respect to any individual, the number of
    months of military service which such department or agency finds
    the individual to have had during any period or periods with
    respect to which the Board's request is made, the date and manner
    of entry into such military service, and the conditions under which
    such service was continued. Any department or agency of the United
    States which is authorized to make awards of pensions, disability
    compensation, or any other gratuitous benefits or allowances
    payable, on the periodic basis or otherwise, under any other Act of
    Congress on the basis of military service, at the request of the
    Board, shall certify to the Board, with respect to any individual,
    the calendar months for all or part of which any such pension,
    compensation, benefit, or allowance is payable to, or with respect
    to, the individual, the amounts of any such pension, compensation,
    benefit, or allowance, and the military service on which such
    pension, compensation, benefit, or allowance is based. Any
    certification made pursuant to the provisions of this subdivision
    shall be conclusive on the Board: Provided, however, That if
    evidence inconsistent with any such certification is submitted, and
    the claim is in the course of adjudication or is otherwise open for
    such evidence, the Board shall refer such evidence to the
    department or agency which made the original certification and such
    department or agency shall make such recertification as in its
    judgment the evidence warrants. Such recertification, and any
    subsequent recertification, shall be conclusive, made in the same
    manner, and subject to the same conditions as an original
    certification.
      (9) The Board shall maintain such offices, provide such
    equipment, furnishings, supplies, services, and facilities, and
    employ such individuals and provide for their compensation and
    expenses as may be necessary for the proper discharge of its
    functions. All positions to which such individuals are appointed,
    except one administrative assistant to each member of the Board,
    shall be in and under the competitive civil service and shall not
    be removed or excepted therefrom. In the employment of such
    individuals under the civil service laws and rules the Board shall
    give preference over all others to individuals who have had
    experience in railroad service, if, in the judgment of the Board,
    they possess the qualifications necessary for the proper discharge
    of the duties of the positions to which they are to be appointed.
    For purposes of its administration of this subchapter or the
    Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act [45 U.S.C. 351 et seq.], or
    both, the Board may place, without regard to the numerical
    limitations contained in section 5108(c)(9) (!2) of title 5, four
    positions in grade GS-16 of the General Schedule established by
    that Act, four positions in grade GS-17 of such schedule, and one
    position in grade GS-18 of such schedule.

    (c) Sources of payments; adjustments
      (1) Benefit payments determined by the Board to be payable under
    this subchapter shall be made by the disbursing agent under
    subsection (b)(4) of this section from money transferred to it from
    the National Railroad Retirement Investment Trust or the Social
    Security Equivalent Benefit Account, as the case may be, except
    that payments of annuity amounts made under sections 231b(h),
    231c(e), and 231c(h) of this title and under sections 204(a)(3),
    204(a)(4), 206(3), and 207(3) of Public Law 93-445 shall be made by
    the disbursing agent under subsection (b)(4) of this section from
    money transferred to it from the Dual Benefits Payments Account. In
    any fiscal year, the total amounts paid under such sections shall
    not exceed the total sums appropriated to the Dual Benefits
    Payments Account for that fiscal year. The Board shall prescribe
    regulations for allocation of annuity amounts which would without
    regard to such regulations be payable under sections 231b(h),
    231c(e), and 231c(h) of this title and sections 204(a)(3),
    204(a)(4), 206(3), and 207(3) of Public Law 93-445 so that the sums
    appropriated to the Dual Benefits Payments Account for a fiscal
    year so far as practicable, are expended in equal monthly
    installments throughout such fiscal year, and are distributed so
    that recipients are paid annuity amounts which bear the same ratio
    to the annuity amounts such recipients would have received but for
    such regulations as the ratio of the total sums appropriated to pay
    such annuity amounts bear to the total sums necessary to pay such
    annuity amounts without regard to such regulations. Notwithstanding
    any other provision of law, the entitlement of an individual to an
    annuity amount under section 231b(h), 231c(e), or 231c(h) of this
    title or section 204(a)(3), 204(a)(4), 206(3), or 207(3) of Public
    Law 93-445 for any month in which the amount payable to such
    individual is allocated under the regulations prescribed by the
    Board under this subsection shall not exceed the amount so
    allocated for that month to such individual.
      (2) At the close of the fiscal year ending June 30, 1975, and
    each fiscal year thereafter, the Board and the Secretary of Health
    and Human Services shall determine the amounts, if any, which if
    added to or subtracted from the Federal Old-Age and Survivors
    Insurance Trust Fund, the Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund,
    and the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund would place each such
    Trust Fund in the same position in which it would have been if (A)
    service as an employee after December 31, 1936, had been included
    in the term "employment" as defined in the Social Security Act [42
    U.S.C. 301 et seq.] and in the Federal Insurance Contributions Act
    [26 U.S.C. 3101 et seq.] and (B) this subchapter had not been
    enacted. Such determination with respect to each such Trust Fund
    shall be made no later than June 15 following the close of the
    fiscal year. If, pursuant to any such determination, any amount is
    to be added to any such Trust Fund, the Board shall, within ten
    days after the determination, certify such amount to the Secretary
    of the Treasury for transfer from the Railroad Retirement Account
    to such Trust Fund. If, pursuant to any such determination, any
    amount is to be subtracted from any such Trust Fund, the Secretary
    of Health and Human Services shall, within ten days after the
    determination, certify such amount to the Secretary of the Treasury
    for transfer from such Trust Fund to the Railroad Retirement
    Account. Any amounts so certified shall further include interest
    (at the rate determined in subdivision (3) for the fiscal year
    under consideration) payable from the close of such fiscal year
    until the date of certification. The Secretary of the Treasury is
    authorized and directed to transfer to the Railroad Retirement
    Account from the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust
    Fund, the Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund, or the Federal
    Hospital Insurance Trust Fund or to any such Trust Fund from the
    Railroad Retirement Account, as the case may be, such amounts as,
    from time to time, may be determined by the Board and the Secretary
    of Health and Human Services pursuant to the provisions of this
    subdivision and certified by the Board or the Secretary of Health
    and Human Services for transfer from any such Trust Fund or from
    the Railroad Retirement Account.
      (3) For purposes of subdivision (2), for any fiscal year, the
    rate of interest to be used shall be equal to the average rate of
    interest, computed as of May 31 preceding the close of such fiscal
    year, borne by all interest-bearing obligations of the United
    States then forming a part of the public debt; except that where
    such average rate is not a multiple of one-eighth of 1 per centum,
    the rate of interest shall be the multiple of one-eighth of 1 per
    centum next lower than such average rate.
      (4) After the end of each month beginning with the month of
    October 1983, the Board shall determine the net amount, if any,
    which if added to or subtracted from the Federal Old-Age and
    Survivors Insurance Trust Fund, the Federal Disability Insurance
    Trust Fund, and the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund would,
    with respect to such month, place those Trust Funds, taken as a
    whole, in the same position in which they would have been if (A)
    service as an employee after December 31, 1936, had been included
    in the term "employment" as defined in the Social Security Act [42
    U.S.C. 301 et seq.] and in the Federal Insurance Contributions Act
    [26 U.S.C. 3101 et seq.], and (B) this subchapter had not been
    enacted. If for any month the net amount so determined would be
    subtracted from those Trust Funds, the Board shall, within ten days
    after the end of such month, report such amount to the Secretary of
    the Treasury for transfer from the general fund to the Railroad
    Retirement Account. Any amount so reported shall further include
    interest (at an annual rate equal to the rate of interest borne by
    a special obligation issued to the Railroad Retirement Account in
    the month in which the transfer is made to the Account) payable
    from the close of the month for which the transfer is made until
    the date of transfer. The Secretary of the Treasury is authorized
    and directed to transfer to the Railroad Retirement Account from
    the general fund such amounts as, from time to time, may be
    determined by the Board pursuant to the provisions of this
    subdivision and reported by the Board for transfer. For such
    purpose the Secretary of the Treasury is authorized to use as a
    public debt transaction the proceeds of the sale of any securities
    issued after August 12, 1983, under section 3102 of title 31, and
    the purpose for which securities may be issued under section 3102
    of title 31 are extended to include such purpose. Each such
    transfer shall be made by the Secretary of the Treasury within five
    days after a report of the amount to be transferred is received.
    Not later than December 31 following the close of each fiscal year
    beginning with the fiscal year ending September 30, 1984, the Board
    shall certify to the Secretary of the Treasury the total of all
    amounts transferred pursuant to the provisions of this subdivision
    for months in such fiscal year. Within ten days after a transfer,
    or transfers, pursuant to subdivision (2) for a particular fiscal
    year, the Board shall request the Secretary of the Treasury to
    retransfer from the Railroad Retirement Account to the general fund
    an amount equal to (A) the total of all amounts, exclusive of
    interest, transferred to such Account pursuant to the provisions of
    this subdivision for months in such fiscal year, plus (B) interest
    (at the rate determined in subdivision (3) for such fiscal year)
    payable with respect to each amount transferred for a month during
    such fiscal year from the close of the month for which the transfer
    of the amount was made until the date of retransfer of such amount.
    The Secretary of the Treasury is authorized and directed to
    retransfer from the Railroad Retirement Account to the general fund
    such amounts as, from time to time, may be determined by the Board
    pursuant to the provisions of the preceding sentence of this
    subdivision and reported by the Board for retransfer.
    (d) Hospital insurance benefits; certified beneficiaries;
      disability insurance benefits; services in Canada; exchange of
      information
      (1) The Board shall, for purposes of this subsection, have the
    same authority to determine the rights of individuals described in
    subdivision (2) to have payments made on their behalf for hospital
    insurance benefits consisting of inpatient hospital services,
    posthospital extended care services, home health services, hospice
    care, and outpatient hospital diagnostic services (all hereinafter
    referred to as "services") under section 226 [42 U.S.C. 426], and
    parts A and E of title XVIII [42 U.S.C. 1395c et seq., 1395x et
    seq.], of the Social Security Act as the Secretary of Health and
    Human Services has under such section and such parts with respect
    to individuals to whom such sections and such parts apply. For
    purposes of section 231g of this title, a determination with
    respect to the rights of an individual under this subsection shall,
    except in the case of a provider of services, be considered to be a
    decision with respect to an annuity.
      (2) Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, every person
    who - 
        (i) has attained age 65 and (A) is entitled to an annuity under
      this subchapter or (B) would be entitled to such an annuity had
      he ceased compensated service and, in the case of a spouse or
      divorced wife, had such spouse's husband or wife ceased
      compensated service or (C) bears a relationship to an employee
      which, by reason of section 231b(f)(2) of this title, has been,
      or would be, taken into account in calculating the amount of the
      annuity of such employee; or
        (ii) has not attained age 65 and (A) has been entitled to an
      annuity under section 231a of this title, or under the Railroad
      Retirement Act of 1937 [45 U.S.C. 228a et seq.] and section 231a
      of this title, or could have been includible in the computation
      of an annuity under section 231b(f)(2) of this title, for not
      less than 24 months and (B) could have been entitled for 24
      calendar months, and could currently be entitled, to monthly
      insurance benefits under section 223 of the Social Security Act
      [42 U.S.C. 423] or under section 202 of that Act [42 U.S.C. 402]
      on the basis of disability if service as an employee after
      December 31, 1936, had been included in the term "employment" as
      defined in that Act and if an application for disability benefits
      had been filed,

    shall be certified to the Secretary of Health and Human Services as
    a qualified railroad retirement beneficiary under section 226 of
    the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 426].
      (3) If an individual entitled to an annuity under paragraph (iv)
    or (v) of section 231a(a)(1) of this title would have been insured
    for disability insurance benefits as determined under section
    223(c)(1) of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 423(c)(1)] at the
    time such annuity began, he shall be deemed, solely for purposes of
    paragraph (ii) of subdivision (2), to be entitled to a disability
    insurance benefit under section 223 of the Social Security Act for
    each month, and beginning with the first month, in which he would
    meet the requirements for entitlement to such a benefit, other than
    the requirement of being insured for disability insurance benefits,
    if service as an employee after December 31, 1936, had been
    included in the term "employment" as defined in the Social Security
    Act [42 U.S.C. 301 et seq.] and if an application for disability
    benefits had been filed.
      (4) The rights of individuals described in subdivision (2) of
    this subsection to have payment made on their behalf for the
    services referred to in subdivision (1) but provided in Canada
    shall be the same as those of individuals to whom section 226 [42
    U.S.C. 426] and part A of title XVIII [42 U.S.C. 1395c et seq.] of
    the Social Security Act apply, and this subdivision shall be
    administered by the Board as if the provisions of section 226 and
    part A of title XVIII of the Social Security Act were applicable,
    as if references to the Secretary of Health and Human Services were
    to the Board, as if references to the Federal Hospital Insurance
    Trust Fund were to the Railroad Retirement Account, as if
    references to the United States or a State included Canada or a
    subdivision thereof, and as if the provisions of sections
    1862(a)(4), 1863, 1864, 1868, 1869, 1874(b), and 1875 [42 U.S.C.
    1395y(a)(4), 1395z, 1395aa, 1395ee, 1395ff, 1395kk(b), 1395ll] were
    not included in such title. The payments for services herein
    provided for in Canada shall be made from the Railroad Retirement
    Account (in accordance with, and subject to, the conditions
    applicable under subsection (b) of this section, in making payment
    of other benefits) to the hospital, extended care facility, or home
    health agency providing such services in Canada to individuals to
    whom subdivision (2) of this subsection applies, but only to the
    extent that the amount of payments for services otherwise hereunder
    provided for an individual exceeds the amount payable for like
    services provided pursuant to the law in effect in the place in
    Canada where such services are furnished. For the purposes of
    section 231i of this title, any overpayment under this subdivision
    shall be treated as if it were an overpayment of an annuity.
      (5) The Board and the Secretary of Health and Human Services
    shall furnish each other with such information, records, and
    documents as may be considered necessary to the administration of
    this subsection or section 226 [42 U.S.C. 426], and part A of title
    XVIII [42 U.S.C. 1395c et seq.], of the Social Security Act.
    (e) Acceptance of gifts and bequests
      The Board is authorized to accept on behalf of the United States
    money gifts and bequests made unconditionally to the Railroad
    Retirement Account, to the Railroad Retirement Supplemental
    Account, or to the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Account, or to
    the Board, or any member, officer, or employee thereof, for the
    benefit of such accounts or any activity financed through such
    accounts. Any such gift accepted pursuant to the authority granted
    in this subsection shall be deposited in the specific account
    designated by the donor or, if the donor has made no such specific
    designation, in the Railroad Retirement Account.
    (f) Congressional copies of documents submitted or transmitted to
      President or Office of Management and Budget
      Whenever the Board submits or transmits any budget estimate,
    budget request, supplemental budget estimate, or other budget
    information, legislative recommendation, prepared testimony for
    congressional hearings, or comment on legislation to the President
    or to the Office of Management and Budget, it shall concurrently
    transmit a copy thereof to the Congress. No officer or agency of
    the United States shall have any authority to require the Board to
    submit its budget requests or estimates, legislative
    recommendations, prepared testimony for congressional hearings, or
    comments on legislation to any officer or agency of the United
    States for approval, comments, or review, prior to the submission
    of such recommendations, testimony, or comments to the Congress.

      As originally enacted, the third sentence of subsec. (b)(6) of
    this section contained words "and the District Court of the United
    States for the District of Columbia" after "the several district
    courts of the United States". The words "and the District Court of
    the United States for the District of Columbia" have been deleted
    entirely as superfluous in view of section 132(a) of Title 28,
    Judiciary and Judicial Procedure, which states that "There shall be
    in each judicial district a district court which shall be a court
    of record known as the United States District Court for the
    district" and section 88 of the Title 28 which states that "the
    District of Columbia constitutes one judicial district".
      In the fourth sentence of subsec. (b)(6) of this section, "United
    States District Court for the District of Columbia" substituted for
    "District Court of the United States for the District of Columbia"

    provided for such substitution to be made in all laws of the United
    States in force on September 1, 1948. See note captioned "Circuit
    Court of Appeals:" "Senior Circuit Judge," Etc. Defined, set out
    under section 451 of Title 28, Judiciary and Judicial Procedure.
      In subsec. (b)(9), "section 5108(c)(9) of title 5" substituted
    for "section 505 of the Classification Act of 1949, as amended", on
    authority of Pub. L. 89-554, Sec. 7(b), Sept. 6, 1966, 80 Stat.
    631, the first section of which enacted Title 5, Government
    Organization and Employees. Section 505 of the Classification Act
    of 1949 had enacted section 1105 of former Title 5, Executive
    Departments and Government Officers and Employees.
      August 12, 1983, referred to in subsec. (c)(4), was in the
    original "the date of enactment of this Act" which was translated
    as meaning the date of enactment of Pub. L. 98-76, which enacted
    subsec. (c)(4) of this section, to reflect the probable intent of
    Congress.

      Employers shall file with the Board, in such manner and form and

    returns of compensation of employees, and, if the Board shall so
    require, shall furnish employees with statements of their
    compensation as reported to the Board. The Board's record of the
    compensation so returned shall be conclusive as to the amount of
    compensation paid to an employee during each period covered by the
    return, and the fact that the Board's records show that no return
    was made of the compensation claimed to have been paid to an
    employee during a particular period shall be taken as conclusive
    that no compensation was paid to such employee during that period,
    unless the error in the amount of compensation returned in the one
    case, or the failure to make return of the compensation in the
    other case, is called to the attention of the Board within four
    years after the day on which return of the compensation was

    Sec. 231i. Erroneous payments

-STATUTE-
    (a) Recovery
      If the Board finds that at any time more than the correct amount
    of annuities or other benefits has been paid to any individual
    under this subchapter, or payment has been made to an individual
    not entitled thereto, recovery by adjustment in subsequent payments
    to which such individual, or any other individual on the basis of
    the same compensation, wages, or self-employment income, is
    entitled under this subchapter, or the Railroad Unemployment
    Insurance Act [45 U.S.C. 351 et seq.] may, except as otherwise
    provided in this section, be made under regulations prescribed by
    the Board. If the individual to whom more than the correct amount
    has been paid dies before recovery is completed, recovery may be
    made by setoff or adjustments, under regulations prescribed by the
    Board, in subsequent payments due, under this subchapter, or the
    Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act, to the estate of such
    individual or to any person on the basis of the compensation,
    wages, or self-employment income of such individual. The Board
    shall have the authority to recover from any payment which would be
    made to an individual by the Board under section 231f(b)(2) of this
    title the amount of annuity payments made to such individual which
    are erroneous because of such individual's entitlement to monthly
    insurance benefits under title II of the Social Security Act [42
    U.S.C. 401 et seq.].
    (b) Adjustments
      Adjustments under this section may be made either by deductions
    from subsequent payments or, with respect to payments which are to
    be made during a lifetime or lifetimes, by subtracting the total
    amount of annuities or other benefits paid in excess of the proper
    amount from the actuarial value, as determined by the Board, of
    such payments to be made during a lifetime or lifetimes and
    recertifying such payments on the basis of the reduced actuarial
    value. In the latter case, recovery shall be deemed to have been
    completed upon such recertification.
    (c) Decision not to recover
      There shall be no recovery in any case in which more than the
    correct amount of annuities or other benefits has been paid under
    this subchapter to an individual or payment has been made to an
    individual not entitled thereto who, in the judgment of the Board,
    is without fault when, in the judgment of the Board, recovery would
    be contrary to the purpose of this subchapter or the Railroad
    Unemployment Insurance Act [45 U.S.C. 351 et seq.] or would be
    against equity or good conscience.
    (d) Liability of officers
      No certifying or disbursing officer shall be held liable for any
    amount certified or paid by him in good faith to any person where
    the recovery of such amount is waived under subsection (c) of this
    section or has been begun but cannot be completed under subsection
    (a) of this section.

    notice, in a form and manner acceptable to the Board, that he is an
    incompetent, or a minor, for whom a guardian or other person

    competency or incompetency of an individual entitled to a benefit
    administered by the Board, the Board may, if it finds the interest
    of such individual to be served thereby, recognize actions by, and
    conduct transactions with, and make payments to, such individual,

    subsection, to take any action necessary or appropriate to perfect
    any right or exercise any privilege of the incompetent or minor and
    to conduct all transactions on his behalf under this subchapter or
    any other Act of Congress now or hereafter administered, in whole
    or in part, by the Board. Any payment made pursuant to the

    Internal Revenue Code of 1986 [26 U.S.C. 1 et seq.],
    notwithstanding any other law of the United States, or of any
    State, territory, or the District of Columbia, no annuity or
    supplemental annuity shall be assignable or be subject to any tax
    or to garnishment, attachment, or other legal process under any
    circumstances whatsoever, nor shall the payment thereof be
    anticipated (!1)

      (b)(1) This section shall not operate to exclude the amount of
    any supplemental annuity paid to an individual under section
    231a(b) of this title from income taxable pursuant to the Federal
    income tax provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 [26
    U.S.C. 1 et seq.].
      (2) This section shall not operate to prohibit the
    characterization or treatment of that portion of an annuity under
    this subchapter which is not computed under section 231b(a),
    231c(a), or 231c(f) of this title, or any portion of a supplemental
    annuity under this subchapter, as community property for the
    purposes of, or property subject to, distribution in accordance
    with a court decree of divorce, annulment, or legal separation or
    the terms of any court-approved property settlement incident to any
    such court decree. The Board shall make payments of such portions
    in accordance with any such characterization or treatment or any
    such decree or settlement.
      (3)(A) Payments made pursuant to paragraph (2) of this subsection
    shall not require that the employee be entitled to an annuity under
    section 231a(a)(1) of this title: Provided, however, That where an
    employee is not entitled to such an annuity, payments made pursuant
    to paragraph (2) may not begin before the month in which the
    following three conditions are satisfied:
        (i) The employee has completed ten years of service in the
      railroad industry or, five years of service all of which accrues
      after December 31, 1995.
        (ii) The spouse or former spouse attains age 62.
        (iii) The employee attains age 62 (or if deceased, would have
      attained age 62).

      (B) Payments made pursuant to paragraph (2) of this subsection
    shall terminate upon the death of the spouse or former spouse,
    unless the court document provides for termination at an earlier
    date. Notwithstanding the language in a court order, that portion
    of payments made pursuant to paragraph (2) which represents
    payments computed pursuant to section 231b(f)(2) of this title
    shall not be paid after the death of the employee.
      (C) If the employee is not entitled to an annuity under section
    231a(a)(1) of this title, payments made pursuant to paragraph (2)
    of this subsection shall be computed as though the employee were
    entitled to an annuity.

    Sec. 231n. Railroad Retirement Account

-STATUTE-
    (a) Maintenance of account; authorization of appropriations
      The Railroad Retirement Account established by section 15(a) of
    the Railroad Retirement Act of 1937 [45 U.S.C. 228o(a)] shall
    continue to be maintained in the Treasury of the United States.
    There is hereby appropriated to such Account for each fiscal year,
    beginning with the fiscal year ending June 30, 1975, to provide for
    the payment of benefits to be made from such Account in accordance
    with the provisions of section 231f(c)(1) of this title, and to
    provide for expenses necessary for the Board in the administration
    of all provisions of this subchapter, an amount equal to amounts
    covered into the Treasury (minus refunds) during each fiscal year
    under the Railroad Retirement Tax Act [26 U.S.C. 3201 et seq.].
    (b) Authorization of appropriations; military service costs and
      administrative expenses
      In addition to the amount appropriated in subsection (a) of this
    section, there is hereby authorized to be appropriated to the
    Railroad Retirement Account for each fiscal year, beginning with
    the fiscal year ending June 30, 1975, such amount as the Board
    determines to be necessary to meet (A) the additional costs,
    resulting from the crediting of military service under this
    subchapter, of benefits payable under section 231a of this title,
    but only to the extent that such Account is not reimbursed for such
    costs under section 231f(c)(2) of this title, (B) the additional
    administrative expenses resulting from the crediting of military
    service under this subchapter, and (C) any loss in interest to such
    Account resulting from the payment of additional benefits based on
    military service credited under this subchapter: Provided, however,
    That, in determining the amount to be appropriated to the Railroad
    Retirement Account for any fiscal year pursuant to the provisions
    of this subsection, there shall not be considered any costs
    resulting from the crediting of military service under this
    subchapter for which appropriations to such Account have already
    been made pursuant to section 4(l) of the Railroad Retirement Act
    of 1937 [45 U.S.C. 228c-1(l)]. Any determination as to loss in
    interest to the Railroad Retirement Account pursuant to clause (C)
    of the first sentence of this subsection shall take into account
    interest from the date each annuity based, in part, on military
    service began to accrue or was increased to the date or dates on
    which the amount appropriated is credited to the Account. The cost
    resulting from the payment of additional benefits under this
    subchapter based on military service determined pursuant to the
    preceding provisions of this subsection shall be adjusted by
    applying thereto the ratio of the total net level cost of all
    benefits under this subchapter to the portion of such net level
    cost remaining after the exclusion of administrative expenses and
    interest charges on the unfunded accrued liability as determined
    under the last completed actuarial valuation pursuant to the
    provisions of subsection (g) of this section. At the close of the
    fiscal year ending June 30, 1975, and each fiscal year thereafter,
    the Board shall, as promptly as practicable, determine the amount
    to be appropriated to the Account pursuant to the provisions of
    this subsection, and shall certify such amount to the Secretary of
    the Treasury for transfer from the general fund in the Treasury to
    the Railroad Retirement Account. When authorized by an
    appropriation Act, the Secretary of the Treasury shall transfer to
    the Railroad Retirement Account from the general fund in the
    Treasury such amounts as, from time to time, may be determined by
    the Board pursuant to the provisions of this subsection and
    certified by the Board for transfer to such Account. In any
    determination made pursuant to section 231f(c)(2) of this title, no
    further charges shall be made against the Trust Funds established
    by title II of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 401 et seq.] for
    military service rendered before January 1, 1957, and with respect
    to which appropriations authorized by clause (2) of the first
    sentence of section 4(l) of the Railroad Retirement Act of 1937
    shall have been credited to the Railroad Retirement Account, but
    the additional benefit payments incurred by such Trust Funds by
    reason of such military service shall be taken in account in making
    any such determination.

    (d) Dual Benefits Payments Account
      (1) There is hereby created an account in the Treasury of the
    United States to be known as the Dual Benefits Payments Account.
    There is hereby authorized to be appropriated to such account for
    each fiscal year beginning with the fiscal year ending September
    30, 1982, such sums as are necessary to pay during such fiscal year
    the amounts of annuities estimated by the Board to be paid under
    sections 231b(h), 231c(e), and 231c(h) of this title and under
    sections 204(a)(3), 204(a)(4), 206(3), and 207(3) of Public Law 93-
    445. Not more than 30 days prior to each fiscal year beginning
    with the fiscal year ending September 30, 1982, the Board may
    request the Secretary of the Treasury to transfer from the Railroad
    Retirement Account to the credit of the Dual Benefits Payments
    Account any amount not exceeding the amount that the Board
    estimates will be necessary to pay on the first day of the next
    succeeding month the annuity amounts under sections 231b(h),
    231c(e), and 231c(h) of this title and under sections 204(a)(3),
    204(a)(4), 206(3), and 207(3) of Public Law 93-445, taking into
    account any reduction in such annuity amounts as determined under
    section 231f(c)(1) of this title, and the Secretary of the Treasury
    shall make such transfer, but at no time shall the total amount of
    money outstanding to the Dual Benefits Payments Account from the
    Railroad Retirement Account exceed the amount necessary to pay the
    annuity amounts under sections 231b(h), 231c(e), and 231c(h) of
    this title and sections 204(a)(3), 204(a)(4), 206(3), and 207(3) of
    Public Law 93-445 for one month. Not more than 10 days after the
    funds appropriated to the Dual Benefits Payments Account for each
    such fiscal year are received into such Account, the Board shall
    request the Secretary of the Treasury to retransfer from the Dual
    Benefits Payments Account to the credit of the Railroad Retirement
    Account an amount equal to the amount transferred to the Dual
    Benefits Payments Account prior to or during such fiscal year under
    the preceding sentence, together with such additional amount
    determined by the Board to be equal to the loss of interest to the
    Railroad Retirement Account resulting from such transfer, and the
    Secretary of the Treasury shall make such retransfer. The Secretary
    of the Treasury shall from time to time transfer from the Dual
    Benefits Payments Account to the disbursing agent under section
    231f(b)(4) of this title amounts necessary to pay benefits payable
    from that Account.
      (2) The Secretary of the Treasury - 
        (i) shall transfer from the general fund as a loan to the Board
      on January 1, 1984, one-third of the special amount described in
      subdivision (3) of this subsection;
        (ii) shall transfer from the general fund as a loan to the
      Board on January 1, 1985, one-third of the special amount
      described in subdivision (3) of this subsection, plus an amount
      equal to the interest that one-third would have earned had it
      been in the Railroad Retirement Account since January 1, 1984;
      and
        (iii) shall transfer from the general fund as a loan to the
      Board on January 1, 1986, the final one-third of the special
      amount described in subdivision (3) of this subsection, plus an
      amount equal to the interest that one-third would have earned had
      it been in the Railroad Retirement Account since January 1, 1984.

      (3) The special amount referred to in subdivision (2) of this
    subsection is the amount which, as of January 1, 1984, would place
    the Railroad Retirement Account in the same position it would have
    been on that date if no annuity amounts had been paid during the
    period beginning January 1, 1975 and ending September 30, 1981,
    under sections 231b(h), 231c(e), and 231c(h) of this title and
    under sections 204(a)(3), 204(a)(4), 206(3), and 207(3) of Public
    Law 93-445, and no sums had been appropriated as authorized in this
    subsection.
      (4) For the purposes of subdivision (2) of this subsection, the
    Secretary of the Treasury is authorized to use as a public debt
    transaction the proceeds of the sale of any securities issued after
    August 12, 1983, under section 3102 of title 31 and the purposes
    for which securities may be so issued are extended to include such
    purposes.
      (5) The amounts transferred to the Board as loans under
    subdivision (2) of this subsection shall be deposited in the
    Railroad Retirement Account.
      (6) The amounts transferred as loans under subdivision (2) of
    this subsection shall be repaid to the general fund to the extent
    sums are appropriated for that purpose, and there are hereby
    authorized to be appropriated, in addition to any other sums
    authorized to be appropriated for the purposes of this subchapter
    and from any sums in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated, such
    sums as may be necessary to make such repayments.
    (e) Investments
      At the request and direction of the Board, it shall be the duty
    of the Secretary of the Treasury (hereinafter referred to as the
    "Secretary") to invest such portion of the amounts credited to the
    Railroad Retirement Account and the Dual Benefits Payments Account
    as are not transferred to the National Railroad Retirement
    Investment Trust as the Board may determine in interest-bearing
    obligations of the United States or in obligations guaranteed as to
    both principal and interest by the United States. For such purpose
    such obligations may be acquired (A) on original issue at the issue
    price; or (B) by purchase of outstanding obligations at the market
    price. The purposes for which obligations of the United States may
    be issued under chapter 31 of title 31, are hereby extended to
    authorize the issuance at par of special obligations exclusively to
    the accounts. Such obligations issued for purchase by the accounts
    shall have maturities fixed with due regard for the needs of the
    accounts, and shall bear interest at a rate equal to the average
    market yield, computed as of the end of the calendar month next
    preceding the date of such issue, borne by all marketable interest-
    bearing notes of the United States then forming a part of the
    public debt that are not due or callable until after the expiration
    of three years from the end of such calendar month, except that
    where such rate is not a multiple of one-eighth of 1 per centum,
    the rate of interest on such obligation shall be the multiple of
    one-eighth of 1 per centum nearest such rate: Provided, That the
    rate of interest on such obligations shall in no case be less than
    3 per centum per annum. At the request of the Board the Secretary
    shall purchase other interest-bearing obligations of the United
    States, or obligations guaranteed as to both principal and interest
    by the United States, or other obligations which are lawful
    investments for trust funds of the United States, on original issue
    or at the market price: Provided, That the interest yield of such
    obligations shall not be less than the interest rate determined in
    accordance with the preceding sentence. At the request of the
    Board, the Secretary shall sell at the market price such
    obligations in the accounts (other than special obligations issued
    exclusively to the accounts) as the Board designates. The Board
    shall from time to time request the Secretary to redeem such
    special obligations issued exclusively to the accounts as the Board
    designates and upon such request the Secretary shall redeem such
    obligations at par plus accrued interest. All requests of the Board
    to the Secretary, provided for in this subsection, shall be
    mandatory upon the Secretary. It shall be the duty of the Board to
    determine at all times what proportion of the accounts shall be
    invested in other than special obligations issued to the accounts
    and further to determine which of such obligations available to the
    accounts consistent with the requirements of this subsection will
    provide the greatest rate of return on the funds invested.
    (f) Actuarial Advisory Committee
      The Board is hereby authorized and directed to select two
    actuaries, one from recommendations made by representatives of
    employees and the other from recommendations made by
    representatives of employers as defined in paragraph (i) of section
    231(a)(1) of this title. These actuaries, along with a third who
    shall be designated by the Secretary of the Treasury, shall be
    known as the Actuarial Advisory Committee with respect to the
    Railroad Retirement Account. The actuaries so selected shall hold
    membership in the American Academy of Actuaries and shall be
    qualified in the evaluation of pension plans: Provided, however,
    That these requirements shall not apply to any actuary who served
    as a member of the Committee prior to January 1, 1975. The
    Committee shall examine the actuarial reports and estimates made by
    the Board and shall have authority to recommend to the Board such
    changes in actuarial methods as they may deem necessary. The
    compensation of the members of the Committee, exclusive of the
    member designated by the Secretary, shall be fixed by the Board on
    a per diem basis.
    (g) Annual report
      The Board shall include in its annual report a statement of the
    status and the operations of the Railroad Retirement and Railroad
    Retirement Supplemental Accounts, and the Dual Benefits Payments
    Account. At intervals not longer than three years the Board shall
    make an estimate of the liabilities created by this subchapter and
    shall include such estimate in its annual report.
    (h) Authorization of appropriations; administrative expenses of
      subchapter
      There are hereby authorized to be appropriated from time to time
    such sums as may be necessary to provide for the expenses of the
    Board in administering the provisions of this subchapter.
    (i) Crediting of accounts for unnegotiated benefit checks
      (1) The Secretary of the Treasury shall implement procedures to
    permit the identification of each check issued for benefits under
    this subchapter that has not been presented for payment by the
    close of the sixth month following the month of its issuance.
      (2) The Secretary of the Treasury shall, on a monthly basis,
    credit each account established in the Treasury for the payment of
    benefits under this subchapter for the proportionate amount of
    benefit checks (including interest thereon) drawn on each such
    Account more than six months previously but not presented for
    payment and not previously credited to such Account, to the extent
    provided in advance in appropriation Acts.
      (3) If a benefit check is presented for payment to the Treasury
    and the amount of the appropriate portion thereof has been
    previously credited pursuant to paragraph (2) to an Account or
    Accounts, the Secretary of the Treasury shall nevertheless pay such
    check, if otherwise proper, recharge such Account or Accounts for
    the amount of such check attributable to such Account or Accounts
    and notify the Board.
      (4) A benefit check bearing a current date may be issued to an
    individual who did not negotiate the original benefit check and who
    surrenders such check for cancellation if the Secretary of the
    Treasury determines it is necessary to effect proper payment of
    benefits.

      (1) Establishment

      in this subsection referred to as the "Trust") is hereby
      established as a trust domiciled in the District of Columbia and
      shall, to the extent not inconsistent with this subchapter, be
      subject to the laws of the District of Columbia applicable to
      such trusts. The Trust shall manage and invest its assets in the
      manner set forth in this subsection.
      (2) Not a Federal agency or instrumentality
        The Trust is not a department, agency, or instrumentality of
      the Government of the United States and shall not be subject to

          (i) Membership
            The Trust shall have a Board of Trustees, consisting of 7
          members. Three shall represent the interests of labor, 3
          shall represent the interests of management, and 1 shall be
          an independent Trustee. The members of the Board of Trustees
          shall not be considered officers or employees of the
          Government of the United States.
          (ii) Selection
            (I) The 3 members representing the interests of labor shall
          be selected by the joint recommendation of labor
          organizations, national in scope, organized in accordance
          with sections 151a and 152 of this title, and representing at
          least  2/3  of all active employees, represented by such
          national labor organizations, covered under this subchapter.
            (II) The 3 members representing the interests of management
          shall be selected by the joint recommendation of carriers as
          defined in section 151 of this title employing at least  2/3 
          of all active employees covered under this subchapter.
            (III) The independent member shall be selected by a
          majority of the other 6 members of the Board of Trustees.

          A member of the Board of Trustees may be removed in the same
          manner and by the same constituency that selected that
          member.
          (iii) Dispute resolution
            In the event that the parties specified in subclause (I),
          (II), or (III) of the previous clause cannot agree on the
          selection of Trustees within 60 days of the date of enactment
          or 60 days from any subsequent date that a position of the
          Board of Trustees becomes vacant, an impartial umpire to
          decide such dispute shall, on the petition of a party to the
          dispute, be appointed by the District Court of the United
          States for the District of Columbia.
        (B) Qualifications
          Members of the Board of Trustees shall be appointed only from
        among persons who have experience and expertise in the
        management of financial investments and pension plans. No
        member of the Railroad Retirement Board shall be eligible to be
        a member of the Board of Trustees.
        (C) Terms
          Except as provided in this subparagraph, each member shall be
        appointed for a 3-year term. The initial members appointed
        under this paragraph shall be divided into equal groups so
        nearly as may be, of which one group will be appointed for a 1-
        year term, one for a 2-year term, and one for a 3-year term.
        The Trustee initially selected pursuant to clause (ii)(III)
        shall be appointed to a 3-year term. A vacancy in the Board of
        Trustees shall not affect the powers of the Board of Trustees
        and shall be filled in the same manner as the selection of the
        member whose departure caused the vacancy. Upon the expiration
        of a term of a member of the Board of Trustees, that member
        shall continue to serve until a successor is appointed.

        other services necessary for the proper administration of the
        Trust;
          (E) sue and be sued and participate in legal proceedings,

        contracts and agreements necessary to carry out its business
        purposes, lend money for such purposes, and deal with property
        as security for the payment of funds so loaned, and possess and

        the Railroad Retirement Board and through it, the participants
        and beneficiaries of the programs funded under this subchapter -
         
            (i) for the exclusive purpose of - 
              (I) providing benefits to participants and their

          the circumstances then prevailing that a prudent person
          acting in a like capacity and familiar with such matters
          would use in the conduct of an enterprise of a like character
          and with like aims;
            (iii) by diversifying investments so as to minimize the
          risk of large losses and to avoid disproportionate influence
          over a particular industry or firm, unless under the
          circumstances it is clearly prudent not to do so; and
            (iv) in accordance with Trust governing documents and
          instruments insofar as such documents and instruments are
          consistent with this subchapter.
        (B) Prohibitions with respect to members of the Board of

          interest or for the Trustee's own account;
            (ii) in an individual or in any other capacity act in any
          transaction involving the assets of the Trust on behalf of a
          party (or represent a party) whose interests are adverse to
          the interests of the Trust, the Railroad Retirement Board, or
          the interests of participants or beneficiaries; or
            (iii) receive any consideration for the Trustee's own

          the Trust.
        (C) Exculpatory provisions and insurance
          Any provision in an agreement or instrument that purports to
        relieve a Trustee from responsibility or liability for any
        responsibility, obligation, or duty under this subchapter shall
        be void: Provided, however, That nothing shall preclude - 
            (i) the Trust from purchasing insurance for its Trustees or
          for itself to cover liability or losses occurring by reason
          of the act or omission of a Trustee, if such insurance
          permits recourse by the insurer against the Trustee in the
          case of a breach of a fiduciary obligation by such Trustee;
            (ii) a Trustee from purchasing insurance to cover liability
          under this section from and for his own account; or

        (D) Bonding
          Every Trustee and every person who handles funds or other
        property of the Trust (hereafter in this subsection referred to
        as "Trust official") shall be bonded. Such bond shall provide
        protection to the Trust against loss by reason of acts of fraud
        or dishonesty on the part of any Trust official, directly or
        through the connivance of others, and shall be in accordance
        with the following:

          amount of the funds handled. In no case shall such bond be
          less than $1,000 nor more than $500,000, except that the
          Railroad Retirement Board, after consideration of the record,
          may prescribe an amount in excess of $500,000, subject to the
          10 per centum limitation of the preceding sentence.
            (ii) It shall be unlawful for any Trust official to
          receive, handle, disburse, or otherwise exercise custody or
          control of any of the funds or other property of the Trust
          without being bonded as required by this subsection and it
          shall be unlawful for any Trust official, or any other person
          having authority to direct the performance of such functions,
          to permit such functions, or any of them, to be performed by
          any Trust official, with respect to whom the requirements of
          this subsection have not been met.
            (iii) It shall be unlawful for any person to procure any
          bond required by this subsection from any surety or other
          company or through any agent or broker in whose business
          operations such person has any control or significant
          financial interest, direct or indirect.
        (E) Audit and report
          (i) The Trust shall annually engage an independent qualified
        public accountant to audit the financial statements of the
        Trust.

        the Congress not later than 180 days after the end of the
        Trust's fiscal year. A management report under this subsection
        shall include - 
            (I) a statement of financial position;
            (II) a statement of operations;
            (III) a statement of cash flows;
            (IV) a statement on internal accounting and administrative
          control systems;
            (V) the report resulting from an audit of the financial
          statements of the Trust conducted under clause (i); and
            (VI) any other comments and information necessary to inform
          the Congress about the operations and financial condition of
          the Trust.

          (iii) The Trust shall provide the President, the Railroad
        Retirement Board, and the Director of the Office of Management
        and Budget a copy of the management report when it is submitted
        to Congress.
        (F) Enforcement
          The Railroad Retirement Board may bring a civil action - 
            (i) to enjoin any act or practice by the Trust, its Board
          of Trustees, or its employees or agents that violates any
          provision of this subchapter; or
            (ii) to obtain other appropriate relief to redress such
          violations, or to enforce any provisions of this subchapter.
      (6) State and local taxes

      property, or other similar tax or fee imposed or levied by a
      State, political subdivision, or local taxing authority. The
      district courts of the United States shall have original
      jurisdiction over a civil action brought by the Trust to enforce
      this subsection and may grant equitable or declaratory relief
      requested by the Trust.
      (7) Quorum
        Five members of the Board of Trustees constitute a quorum to do
      business. Investment guidelines must be adopted by a unanimous
      vote of the Trustees then holding office. All other decisions of
      the Board of Trustees shall be decided by a majority vote of the
      quorum present. All decisions of the Board of Trustees shall be
      entered upon the records of the Board of Trustees.
    (k) Transfers to the Trust
      The Board shall, upon establishment of the National Railroad
    Retirement Investment Trust and from time to time thereafter,
    direct the Secretary of the Treasury to transfer, in such manner as
    will maximize the investment returns to the Railroad Retirement
    system, that portion of the Railroad Retirement Account that is not
    needed to pay current administrative expenses of the Board to the
    National Railroad Retirement Investment Trust. The Secretary shall
    make that transfer.
    (l) National Railroad Retirement Investment Trust
      The National Railroad Retirement Investment Trust shall from time
    to time transfer to the disbursing agent described in section
    231f(b)(4) of this title or as otherwise directed by the Railroad
    Retirement Board pursuant to section 231f(b)(4) of this title, such
    amounts as may be necessary to pay benefits under this subchapter
    (other than benefits paid from the Social Security Equivalent
    Benefit Account or the Dual Benefit Payments Account).

    Sec. 231n-1. Social Security Equivalent Benefit Account

-STATUTE-
    (a) Establishment
      There is hereby created an account in the Treasury of the United
    States to be known as the "Social Security Equivalent Benefit
    Account".
    (b) Transfers, etc., to Social Security Equivalent Benefit Account
      (1) There is hereby appropriated to the Social Security
    Equivalent Benefit Account for each fiscal year, beginning with the
    fiscal year beginning October 1, 1984, an amount equal to the sum
    of the following amounts:
        (A) Amounts covered into the Treasury (minus refunds) during
      such fiscal year under sections 3201(a), 3211(a)(1), and 3221(a)
      of the Railroad Retirement Tax Act [26 U.S.C. 3201(a),
      3211(a)(1), 3221(a)].
        (B) The amount which (but for this section) would have been
      transferred to the Railroad Retirement Account under section
      121(e) of the Social Security Amendments of 1983 to the extent
      that the amount which would have been so transferred is
      attributable to taxation of social security equivalent benefits.

    Amounts appropriated to the Railroad Retirement Account shall be
    appropriately reduced to take into account the amounts appropriated
    under this paragraph to the Social Security Equivalent Benefit
    Account.
      (2) On and after October 1, 1984, any amount which (but for this
    section) would have been transferred to the Railroad Retirement
    Account pursuant to paragraph (2) or (4) of section 231f(c) of this
    title shall be transferred to the Social Security Equivalent
    Benefit Account. On and after October 1, 1984, no transfer shall be
    made to the Railroad Retirement Account pursuant to paragraph (2)
    or (4) of section 231f(c) of this title.
      (3) To the extent that the authorization for appropriation
    contained in section 231n(b) of this title is attributable to the
    cost of social security equivalent benefits, on and after October
    1, 1984, any reference in such section to the Railroad Retirement
    Account shall be treated as a reference to the Social Security
    Equivalent Benefit Account.
      (4) Amounts appropriated or transferred to the Social Security
    Equivalent Benefit Account under this section shall be credited or
    transferred to such Account at the same time and in the same manner
    as such amounts would have been credited or transferred to the
    Railroad Retirement Account but for this section.
    (c) Availability and transfer of funds
      (1) Except as otherwise provided in this section, amounts in the
    Social Security Equivalent Benefit Account shall be available only
    for purposes of paying social security equivalent benefits under
    this subchapter and to provide for the administrative expenses of
    the Board allocable to social security equivalent benefits. The
    Secretary shall from time to time transfer to the disbursing agent
    under section 231f(b)(4) of this title amounts necessary to pay
    those benefits.
      (2) On and after October 1, 1984, any transfer which (but for
    this paragraph) would be required to be made from the Railroad
    Retirement Account under paragraph (2) or (4) of section 231f(c) of
    this title shall be made from the Social Security Equivalent
    Benefit Account.
    (d) Transfers to Social Security Equivalent Benefit Account and
      National Railroad Retirement Investment Trust
      (1) Whenever the Board finds that the balance in the Social
    Security Equivalent Benefit Account will be insufficient to pay
    social security equivalent benefits which it estimates are due in
    any month, it shall request the Secretary of the Treasury to
    transfer from the Railroad Retirement Account to the credit of the
    Social Security Equivalent Benefit Account such moneys as the Board
    estimates will be necessary for the payment of such benefits, and
    the Secretary shall make such transfer.
      (2) Upon establishment of the National Railroad Retirement
    Investment Trust and from time to time thereafter, the Board shall
    direct the Secretary of the Treasury to transfer, in such manner as
    will maximize the investment returns to the Railroad Retirement
    system, the balance of the Social Security Equivalent Benefit
    Account not needed to pay current benefits and administrative
    expenses required to be paid from that Account to the National
    Railroad Retirement Investment Trust or the Railroad Retirement
    Account, and the Secretary shall make that transfer. Any balance
    transferred under this paragraph shall be used by the National
    Railroad Retirement Investment Trust or the Railroad Retirement
    Board only to pay benefits under this subchapter or to purchase
    obligations of the United States (either directly or through a
    commingled account consisting only of such obligations) that are
    backed by the full faith and credit of the United States pursuant
    to chapter 31 of title 31. The proceeds of sales of, and the
    interest income from, such obligations shall be used by the Trust
    only to pay benefits under this subchapter or to purchase such
    additional obligations.
    (e) Applicability of section 231n
      The provisions of subsections (e), (f), and (g) of section 231n
    of this title are hereby made applicable to the Social Security
    Equivalent Benefit Account.
    (f) References to Railroad Retirement Account deemed references to
      Social Security Equivalent Benefit Account; "social security
      equivalent benefits" defined
      (1) For purposes of making payments of social security equivalent
    benefits, references in the (!1) subchapter to the Railroad
    Retirement Account shall be treated as references to the Social
    Security Equivalent Benefit Account.

      (2) For purposes of this section, the term "social security
    equivalent benefits" means benefits payable under this subchapter
    which are of a kind taken into account in determining the amount of
    transfers made under section 231f(c)(2) of this title.

      (2) For the purpose of determining (i) monthly insurance benefits
    under the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 301 et seq.] to an
    employee who will have completed less than ten years of service (or
    less than five years of service, all of which accrues after
    December 31, 1995) and to others deriving from him or her during
    his or her life and (ii) monthly insurance benefits and lump-sum

    Sec. 231r. Automatic benefit eligibility requirement adjustments

-STATUTE-
    (a) Reduced benefits
      If title II of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 401 et seq.] is
    amended at any time after December 31, 1974, to reduce the
    eligibility requirements for old-age insurance benefits, disability
    insurance benefits, wife's insurance benefits payable to a wife,
    husband's insurance benefits, child's insurance benefits payable to
    a child of a deceased individual, widow's insurance benefits
    payable to a widow, widower's insurance benefits, mother's
    insurance benefits payable to a widow, or parent's insurance
    benefits, such reduced eligibility requirements shall be
    applicable, in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Board,
    to individuals, spouses, or survivors, as the case may be, under
    section 231a of this title to the extent that such reduced
    eligibility requirements would provide such individuals, spouses,
    or survivors with entitlement to annuities under such section 231a
    of this title to which they would not be entitled except for such
    reduced eligibility requirements: Provided, however, That no
    annuity shall be paid to any person pursuant to the provisions of
    this subsection if that person does not satisfy an eligibility
    requirement imposed by section 231a of this title of a kind not
    imposed by the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 301 et seq.] on
    December 31, 1974, or an eligibility requirement imposed by section
    231a of this title of a kind which was imposed by the Social
    Security Act on December 31, 1974, but which was not reduced by the
    amendment to that Act: Provided further, That the annuity amounts
    to which such individuals, spouses, or survivors will be entitled
    under this subchapter by reason of the provisions of this
    subsection shall be only such amounts as are determined under the
    provisions of section 231b(a), 231c(a), or 231c(f), respectively,
    of this title.
    (b) Additional eligible beneficiaries
      If title II of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 401 et seq.] is
    amended at any time after December 31, 1974, to provide monthly
    insurance benefits under that Act to a class of beneficiaries not
    entitled to such benefits thereunder prior to January 1, 1975,
    every person who is a member of such class of beneficiaries shall
    be entitled to annuities under section 231a of this title, in
    accordance with regulations prescribed by the Board, in an amount
    equal to the amount of the monthly insurance benefit to which such
    person would have been entitled under the Social Security Act [42
    U.S.C. 301 et seq.] if service as an employee after December 31,
    1936, had been included in the term "employment" as defined in that
    Act.
    (c) Reduced conditions of entitlement; expanded benefits
      If section 226 [42 U.S.C. 426] or title XVIII [42 U.S.C. 1395 et
    seq.] of the Social Security Act is amended at any time after
    December 31, 1974, to reduce the conditions of entitlement to, or
    to expand the nature of, the benefits payable thereunder, or if
    health care benefits in addition to, or in lieu of, the benefits
    payable under such section 226 or such title XVIII are provided by
    any provision of law which becomes effective at any time after
    December 31, 1974, such reductions in the conditions of entitlement
    to benefits, such expanded benefits, or such additional, or
    substituted, health care benefits shall be available to every
    employee (as defined in this subchapter), and those deriving from
    him, in the same manner, and to the same extent, as if his service
    as an employee after December 31, 1936, had been included in the
    term "employment" as defined in the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C.
    301 et seq.]. The Board shall have the same authority, in
    accordance with regulations prescribed by it, to determine the
    rights of employees who will have completed ten years of service
    (or five or more years of service, all of which accrues after
    December 31, 1995), and of those deriving from such employees, to
    benefits provided by reason of the provisions of this subsection as
    the Secretary of Health and Human Services has with respect to
    individuals insured under the Social Security Act.
    (d) Limitations
      Notwithstanding the provisions of subsections (a), (b), and (c)
    of this section - 
        (1) No annuity or other benefit shall be payable to any person
      on the basis of the compensation and years of service of an
      individual by reason of the provisions of subsection (a), (b), or
      (c) of this section if, and to the extent that, such annuity or
      other benefit would duplicate a benefit payable to such person on
      the basis of such compensation and years of service under a
      provision of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 301 et seq.], or
      any other Act of Congress, which becomes effective after December
      31, 1974.
        (2) No annuity shall be payable to a person by reason of
      subsection (a) or (b) of this section unless the individual upon
      whose compensation and years of service such annuity would be
      based will have (A) completed ten years of service (or five or
      more years of service, all of which accrues after December 31,
      1995), and (B) in the case of a survivor, had a current
      connection with the railroad industry at the time of his death.
        (3) If the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 301 et seq.] is
      amended after December 31, 1974, to remove any, or all,
      restriction on the receipt of more than one monthly insurance
      benefit thereunder, annuity amounts provided a person under
      section 231b(h), 231c(e), or 231c(h) of this title, or under
      section 204(a)(3), 204(a)(4), 206(3), or 207(3) of title II of
      this Act, shall be reduced (but not below zero) by the amount of
      any annuity provided such person under this subchapter by reason
      of such amendment.
        (4) If and to the extent that an annuity or other benefit
      payable to a person by reason of the provisions of subsection
      (a), (b), or (c) of this section duplicates an annuity or other
      benefit then payable to such person under other provisions of
      this subchapter, such annuity or other benefit then payable under
      other provisions of this subchapter shall be reduced (but not
      below zero) by the amount of the annuity or other benefit payable
      by reason of subsection (a), (b), or (c) of this section.

    Sec. 231u. Benefit preservation

-STATUTE-
      (a)(1) On or before May 1 of each year beginning in 1984, the
    Railroad Retirement Board shall prepare a five-year projection of
    anticipated revenues to and payments from the Railroad Retirement
    Account to determine the ability of such Account to pay benefits in
    each of the next succeeding five calendar years. On or before May 1
    of each year beginning in 2003, the Railroad Retirement Board shall
    compute its projection of the account benefits ratio and the
    average account benefits ratio (as defined by section 3241(c) of
    the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 [26 U.S.C. 3241(c)]) for each of
    the next succeeding five fiscal years. No later than July 1 of each
    year, the Board shall submit a written report to the President, the
    Speaker of the House, and the President of the Senate setting forth
    the results of the projections prepared pursuant to the preceding
    two sentences. If the projection indicates that the funds in the
    Railroad Retirement Account will be insufficient to pay the full
    amount of the benefits under this subchapter which are payable from
    that Account at any time during the five-year period, the Board's
    report shall include - 
        (A) the first fiscal year during which benefits under this
      subchapter must be reduced, in the absence of any adjustments,
      because insufficient funds (including any general revenue
      borrowing authority under this subchapter) would preclude payment
      of full benefits (other than benfits (!1) payable from the Dual
      Benefits Payments Account) for every month in such fiscal year;

        (B) the first fiscal year during which the Board would
      recommend suspension of the authority to borrow contained in
      section 360(d) of this title, in order to prevent depletion of
      the Railroad Retirement Account; and
        (C) the amount, if any, of adjustments (stated in terms of
      percentage of taxable payroll), and any other changes such as
      cash flow adjustments, necessary to preserve the financial
      solvency of the Railroad Retirement Account, if such adjustments
      were effective at the beginning of the next succeeding fiscal
      year.

      (2) Not less than 20 nor more than 30 days after the submission
    of a written report under this subsection which indicates that, in
    the absence of any adjustments, the Railroad Retirement Account
    will contain insufficient funds to pay the full amount of the
    benefits under this subchapter which are payable from that Account
    at some time during the five-year period covered by the report, the
    Board shall publish such report in the Federal Register.
      (b) Not later than 180 days after the publication in the Federal
    Register of any Board report referred to in subsection (a) of this
    section which states an amount of adjustments (in terms of
    percentage of taxable payroll) necessary to preserve the financial
    solvency of the railroad retirement account - 
        (1) representatives of railroad employees and carriers shall,
      jointly or separately, submit to the President, the Speaker of
      the House, and the President of the Senate, funding proposals
      designed to preserve the financial solvency of the Railroad
      Retirement Account; and
        (2) the President shall submit to the Speaker of the House and
      the President of the Senate such recommendations as he may deem
      appropriate with respect to the preservation of the Railroad
      Retirement Account, including a specific proposal to assure
      continuous payments of social security equivalent benefits by
      separating the social security equivalent benefits from industry
      pension equivalent benefits payable under this subchapter.

      (c) Not later than 180 days after the submission of a written
    report under subsection (a) of this section which states the first
    fiscal year during which benefits under this subchapter must be
    reduced because insufficient funds would preclude payment of full
    benefits for every month of that year, the Board shall issue and
    publish in the Federal Register such regulations as may be
    necessary which shall be designed to - 
        (1) provide a constant level of benefits at the maximum level
      possible for every month of that fiscal year; and
        (2) provide that no individual shall receive less during that
      fiscal year than the amount otherwise payable if the employee's
      service as an employee after December 31, 1936, had been covered
      under the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 301 et seq.], minus the
      amount of any reduction required under section 231b(m) or 231c(i)
      of this title.

    Unless otherwise provided by law enacted after August 13, 1981, or
    by a later report filed by the Board under subsection (a) of this
    section, regulations issued by the Board under this subsection
    shall apply beginning with the fiscal year designated by the Board
    in its written report under subsection (a) of this section. Any
    Board regulation which becomes effective under this subsection may
    be modified, rescinded, or superseded in the same manner and to the
    same extent as in the case of any other Board regulation issued
    under authority of this subchapter.

    of the Railroad Retirement Board, or upon complaint of any party
    interested, to determine after hearing whether any line operated by
    electric power falls within the terms of this proviso. The term
    "employer" shall also include railroad associations, traffic
    associations, tariff bureaus, demurrage bureaus, weighing and
    inspection bureaus, collection agencies, and other associations,
    bureaus, agencies, or organizations controlled and maintained
    wholly or principally by two or more employers as hereinbefore

    with or incidental to railroad transportation; and railway labor
    organizations, national in scope, which have been or may be
    organized in accordance with the provisions of the Railway Labor
    Act [45 U.S.C. 151 et seq.], and their State and National
    legislative committees and their general committees and their
    insurance departments and their local lodges and divisions,
    established pursuant to the constitution and bylaws of such
    organizations. The term "employer" shall not include any company by
    reason of its being engaged in the mining of coal, the supplying of
    coal to an employer where delivery is not beyond the mine tipple,
    and the operation of equipment or facilities therefor, or in any of
    such activities.
      (b) The term "carrier" means a railroad subject to the
    jurisdiction of the Surface Transportation Board under part A of
    subtitle IV of title 49.
      (c) The term "company" includes corporations, associations, and
    joint-stock companies.
      (d) The term "employee" (except when used in phrases establishing
    a different meaning) means any individual who is or has been (i) in
    the service of one or more employers for compensation, or (ii) an
    employee representative. The term "employee" shall include an
    employee of a local lodge or division defined as an employer in
    subsection (a) of this section only if he was in the service of a
    carrier on or after August 29, 1935. The term "employee" includes
    an officer of an employer.
      The term "employee" shall not include any individual while such
    individual is engaged in the physical operations consisting of the
    mining of coal, the preparation of coal, the handling (other than
    movement by rail with standard railroad locomotives) of coal not
    beyond the mine tipple, or the loading of coal at the tipple.
      (e) An individual is in the service of an employer whether his
    service is rendered within or without the United States if (i) he
    is subject to the continuing authority of the employer to supervise
    and direct the manner of rendition of his service, or he is
    rendering professional or technical services and is integrated into
    the staff of the employer, or he is rendering, on the property used
    in the employer's operations, other personal services the rendition
    of which is integrated into the employer's operations, and (ii) he
    renders such service for compensation: Provided, however, That an
    individual shall be deemed to be in the service of an employer,
    other than a local lodge or division or a general committee of a
    railway-labor-organization employer, not conducting the principal
    part of its business in the United States only when he is rendering
    service to it in the United States; and an individual shall be
    deemed to be in the service of such a local lodge or division only
    if (1) all, or substantially all, the individuals constituting its
    membership are employees of an employer conducting the principal
    part of its business in the United States; or (2) the headquarters
    of such local lodge or division is located in the United States;
    and an individual shall be deemed to be in the service of such a
    general committee only if (1) he is representing a local lodge or
    division described in clauses (1) or (2) immediately above; or (2)
    all, or substantially all, the individuals represented by it are
    employees of an employer conducting the principal part of its
    business in the United States; or (3) he acts in the capacity of a
    general chairman or an assistant general chairman of a general
    committee which represents individuals rendering service in the
    United States to an employer, but in such case if his office or
    headquarters is not located in the United States and the
    individuals represented by such general committee are employees of
    an employer not conducting the principal part of its business in
    the United States, only such proportion of the remuneration for
    such service shall be regarded as compensation as the proportion
    which the mileage in the United States under the jurisdiction of
    such general committee bears to the total mileage under its
    jurisdiction, unless such mileage formula is inapplicable, in which
    case the Board may prescribe such other formula as it finds to be
    equitable, and if the application of such mileage formula, or such
    other formula as the Board may prescribe, would result in the
    compensation of the individual being less than 10 per centum of his
    remuneration for such service no part of such remuneration shall be
    regarded as compensation: Provided further, That an individual not
    a citizen or resident of the United States shall not be deemed to
    be in the service of an employer when rendering service outside the
    United States to an employer who is required under the laws
    applicable in the place where the service is rendered to employ
    therein, in whole or in part, citizens or residents thereof.
      (f) The term "employee representative" means any officer or
    official representative of a railway labor organization other than
    a labor organization included in the term employer as defined in
    subsection (a) of this section who before or after August 29, 1935,
    was in the service of an employer as defined in said subsection and
    who is duly authorized and designated to represent employees in
    accordance with the Railway Labor Act [45 U.S.C. 151 et seq.], and
    any individual who is regularly assigned to or regularly employed
    by such officer or official representative in connection with the
    duties of his office.
      (g) The term "employment" means service performed as an employee.
    For the purposes of determining eligibility for and the amount of
    benefits and the amount of contributions due pursuant to this
    chapter, employment after June 30, 1940, in the service of a local
    lodge or division of a railway-labor-organization employer or as an
    employee representative shall be disregarded. For purposes of
    determining eligibility for and the amount of benefits and the
    amount of contributions due pursuant to this chapter, employment as
    a delegate to a national or international convention of a railway
    labor organization defined as an "employer", in subsection (a) of
    this section, shall be disregarded if the individual having such
    employment has not previously rendered service, other than as such
    a delegate, which may be included in his "years of service" for
    purposes of the Railroad Retirement Act [45 U.S.C. 231 et seq.].
      (h) The term "registration period" means, with respect to any
    employee, the period which begins with the first day for which such
    employee registers at an employment office in accordance with such
    regulations as the Board may prescribe, and ends with whichever is
    the earlier of (i) the thirteenth day thereafter, or (ii) the day
    immediately preceding the day for which he next registers at a
    different employment office; and thereafter each period which
    begins with the first day for which he next registers at an
    employment office after the end of his last preceding registration
    period which began with a day for which he registered at an
    employment office and ends with whichever is the earlier of (i) the
    thirteenth day thereafter, or (ii) the day immediately preceding
    the day for which he next registers at a different employment
    office.
      The term "registration period" means also, with respect to any
    employee, the period which begins with the first day with respect
    to which a statement of sickness for a "period of continuing
    sickness" (as defined in section 352(a) of this title) is filed in
    his behalf in accordance with such regulations as the Board may
    prescribe, or the first such day after the end of a registration
    period which will have begun with a day with respect to which a
    statement of sickness for a "period of continuing sickness" (as
    defined in section 352(a) of this title) was filed in his behalf,
    and ends with whichever is the earlier of (i) the thirteenth day
    thereafter, or (ii) the day immediately preceding the day with
    respect to which a statement of sickness for a new "period of
    continuing sickness" (as defined in section 352(a) of this title)
    is filed in his behalf.
      (i)(1) In General. - The term "compensation" means any form of
    money remuneration, including pay for time lost but excluding tips,
    paid for services rendered as an employee to one or more employers,
    or as an employee representative, except that in computing the
    compensation paid to any employee, no part of any month's
    compensation in excess of the monthly compensation base (as defined
    in subdivision (2)) for any month shall be recognized. Solely for
    the purpose of determining the compensation received by an employee
    in a base year, the term "compensation" shall include any
    separation allowance or subsistence allowance paid under any
    benefit schedule provided under section 701 (!1) of title VII of
    the Regional Rail Reorganization Act of 1973 [45 U.S.C. 797] and
    any termination allowance paid under section 702 of that Act [45
    U.S.C. 797a], but does not include any other benefits payable under
    that title [45 U.S.C. 797 et seq.]. The total amount of any
    subsistence allowance payable under a benefit schedule provided
    pursuant to section 701 (!1) of the Regional Rail Reorganization
    Act of 1973 shall be considered as being compensation in the month
    in which the employee first timely filed a claim for such an
    allowance. Such term does not include remuneration for service
    which is performed by a nonresident alien individual for the period
    he is temporarily present in the United States as a nonimmigrant
    under subparagraph (F) or (J) of section 1101(a)(15) of title 8 and
    which is performed to carry out the purpose specified in
    subparagraph (F) or (J) as the case may be. A payment made by an
    employer to an individual through the employer's pay roll shall be
    presumed, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, to be
    compensation for service rendered by such individual as an employee
    of the employer in the period with respect to which the payment is
    made. An employee shall be deemed to be paid, "for time lost" the
    amount he is paid by an employer with respect to an identifiable
    period of absence from the active service of the employer,
    including absence on account of personal injury, and the amount he
    is paid by the employer for loss of earnings resulting from his
    displacement to a less remunerative position or occupation. If a
    payment is made by an employer with respect to a personal injury
    and includes pay for time lost, the total payment shall be deemed
    to be paid for time lost unless, at the time of payment, a part of
    such payment is specifically apportioned to factors other than time
    lost, in which event only such part of the payment as is not so
    apportioned shall be deemed to be paid for time lost. Compensation
    earned in any calendar month before 1947 shall be deemed paid in
    such month regardless of whether or when payment will have been in
    fact made, and compensation earned in any calendar year after 1946
    but paid after the end of such calendar year shall be deemed to be
    compensation paid in the calendar year in which it will have been
    earned if it is so reported by the employer before February 1 of
    the next succeeding calendar year or, if the employee establishes,
    subject to the provisions of section 356 of this title, the period
    during which such compensation will have been earned.

      (2) Monthly Compensation Base. - 
        (A) In general. - For purposes of subdivision (1), the term
      "monthly compensation base" means the amount - 
          (i) of $400 for calendar months before January 1, 1984;
          (ii) of $600 for calendar months after December 31, 1983 and
        before January 1, 1989; and
          (iii) computed under subparagraph (B) for months after
        December 31, 1988.

        (B) Computation. - 
          (i) In general. - The amount of the monthly compensation base
        for each calendar year beginning after December 31, 1988, is
        the greater of - 
            (I) $600; or
            (II) the amount, as rounded under clause (iii) if
          applicable, computed under the formula:


                                       A-37,800                    
                      B=600  (1+   --------------)              
                                        56,700                    


          (ii) Meaning of symbols. - For the purposes of the formula in
        clause (i) - 
            (I) "B" is the dollar amount of the monthly compensation
          base; and
            (II) "A" is the amount of the applicable base with respect
          to tier 1 taxes, for the calendar year for which the monthly
          compensation base is being computed, as determined under
          section 3231(e)(2) of title 26.

          (iii) Rounding rule. - If the monthly compensation base
        computed under this formula is not a multiple of $5, it shall
        be rounded to the nearest multiple of $5, with such rounding
        being upward in the event the amount computed is equidistant
        between two multiples of $5.

      (j) The term "remuneration" means pay for services for hire,
    including pay for time lost, and tips, but pay for time lost shall
    be deemed earned on the day on which such time is lost. The term
    "remuneration" includes also earned income other than for services
    for hire if the accrual thereof in whole or in part is
    ascertainable with respect to a particular day or particular days.
    The term "remuneration" does not include any money payments
    received pursuant to any nongovernmental plan for unemployment
    insurance, maternity insurance, or sickness insurance.
      (k) Subject to the provisions of section 354 of this title (1) a
    day of unemployment, with respect to any employee, means a calendar
    day on which he is able to work and is available for work and with
    respect to which (i) no remuneration is payable or accrues to him,
    and (ii) he has, in accordance with such regulations as the Board
    may prescribe, registered at an employment office; and (2) a "day
    of sickness", with respect to any employee, means a calendar day on
    which because of any physical, mental, psychological, or nervous
    injury, illness, sickness, or disease he is not able to work, or,
    with respect to a female employee, a calendar day on which, because
    of pregnancy, miscarriage, or the birth of a child, (i) she is
    unable to work or (ii) working would be injurious to her health,
    and with respect to which (i) no remuneration is payable or accrues
    to him, and (ii) in accordance with such regulations as the Board
    may prescribe, a statement of sickness is filed within such
    reasonable period, not in excess of ten days, as the Board may
    prescribe: Provided, however, That "subsidiary remuneration", as
    hereinafter defined in this subsection, shall not be considered
    remuneration for the purpose of this subsection except with respect
    to an employee whose base-year compensation, exclusive of earnings
    from the position or occupation in which he earned such subsidiary
    remuneration, is less than an amount that is equal to 2.5 times the
    monthly compensation base for months in such base year as computed
    under subsection (i) of this section: Provided further, That
    remuneration for a working day which includes a part of each of two
    consecutive calendar days shall be deemed to have been earned on
    the first of such two days, and any individual who takes work for
    such working day shall not by reason thereof be deemed not
    available for work on the second of such calendar days: Provided
    further, That any calendar day on which no remuneration is payable
    to or accrues to an employee solely because of the application to
    him of mileage or work restrictions agreed upon in schedule
    agreements between employers and employees or solely because he is
    standing by for or laying over between regularly assigned trips or
    tours of duty shall not be considered either a day of unemployment
    or a day of sickness.
      For the purpose of this subsection, the term "subsidiary
    remuneration" means, with respect to any employee, remuneration not
    in excess of an average of $15 a day for the period with respect to
    which such remuneration is payable or accrues, if the work from
    which the remuneration is derived (i) requires substantially less
    than full time as determined by generally prevailing standards, and
    (ii) is susceptible of performance at such times and under such
    circumstances as not to be inconsistent with the holding of normal
    full-time employment in another occupation.
      (l)(1) The term "benefits" (except in phrases clearly designating
    other payments) means the money payments payable to an employee as
    provided in this chapter, with respect to his unemployment or
    sickness.
      (2) The term "statement of sickness" means a statement with
    respect to days of sickness of an employee, executed in such manner

    Board may prescribe by regulations.
      (m) The term "benefit year" means the twelve-month period
    beginning July 1 of any year and ending June 30 of the next year,

    immediately preceding the beginning of the benefit year.
      (o) The term "employment office" means a free employment office

    Sec. 352. Benefits

-STATUTE-
    (a) Days for which benefits payable; determination of amount
      (1)(A) Payment of Unemployment Benefits. - 
        (i) Generally. - Except as otherwise provided in this
      subparagraph, benefits shall be payable to any qualified employee
      for each day of unemployment in excess of 4 during any
      registration period within a period of continuing unemployment.
        (ii) Waiting period for first registration period. - Benefits
      shall be payable to any qualified employee for each day of
      unemployment in excess of 7 during that employee's first
      registration period in a period of continuing unemployment if
      such period of continuing unemployment is the employee's initial
      period of continuing unemployment commencing in the benefit year.
        (iii) Strikes. - 
          (I) Initial 14-day waiting period. - If the Board finds that
        a qualified employee has a period of continuing unemployment
        that includes days of unemployment due to a stoppage of work
        because of a strike in the establishment, premises, or
        enterprise at which such employee was last employed, no
        benefits shall be payable for such employee's first 14 days of
        unemployment due to such stoppage of work.
          (II) Subsequent days of unemployment. - For subsequent days
        of unemployment due to the same stoppage of work, benefits
        shall be payable as provided in clause (i) of this
        subparagraph.
          (III) Subsequent periods of continuing unemployment. - If
        such period of continuing unemployment ends by reason of clause
        (v) but the stoppage of work continues, the waiting period
        established in clause (ii) shall apply to the employee's first
        registration period in a new period of continuing unemployment
        based upon the same stoppage of work.

        (iv) Definition of period of continuing unemployment. - Except
      as limited by clause (v), for the purposes of this subparagraph,
      the term "period of continuing unemployment" means - 
          (I) a single registration period that includes more than 4
        days of unemployment;
          (II) a series of consecutive registration periods, each of
        which includes more than 4 days of unemployment; or
          (III) a series of successive registration periods, each of
        which includes more than 4 days of unemployment, if each
        succeeding registration period begins within 15 days after the
        last day of the immediately preceding registration period.

        (v) Special rule regarding end of period. - For purposes of
      applying clause (ii), a period of continuing unemployment ends
      when an employee exhausts rights to unemployment benefits under
      subsection (c) of this section.
        (vi) Limit on amount of benefits. - No benefits shall be
      payable to an otherwise eligible employee for any day of
      unemployment in a registration period where the total amount of
      the remuneration (as defined in section 351(j) of this title)
      payable or accruing to him for days within such registration
      period exceeds the amount of the base year monthly compensation
      base. For purposes of the preceding sentence, an employee's
      remuneration shall be deemed to include the gross amount of any
      remuneration that would have become payable to that employee but
      did not become payable because that employee was not ready or
      willing to perform suitable work available to that employee on
      any day within such registration period.

      (B) Payment of Sickness Benefits. - 
        (i) Generally. - Except as otherwise provided in this
      subparagraph, benefits shall be payable to any qualified employee
      for each day of sickness after the 4th consecutive day of
      sickness in a period of continuing sickness but excluding 4 days
      of sickness in any registration period in such period of
      continuing sickness.
        (ii) Waiting period for first registration period. - Benefits
      shall be payable to any qualified employee for each day of
      sickness in excess of 7 during that employee's first registration
      period in a period of continuing sickness if such period of
      continuing sickness is the employee's initial period of
      continuing sickness commencing in the benefit year. For the
      purposes of this clause, the first registration period in a
      period of continuing sickness is that registration period that
      first begins with 4 consecutive days of sickness and includes
      more than 4 days of sickness.
        (iii) Definition of period of continuing sickness. - For the
      purposes of this subparagraph, a period of continuing sickness
      means - 
          (I) a period of consecutive days of sickness, whether from 1
        or more causes; or
          (II) a period of successive days of sickness due to a single
        cause without interruption of more than 90 consecutive days
        which are not days of sickness.

        (iv) Special rule regarding end of period. - For purposes of
      applying clause (ii), a period of continuing sickness ends when
      an employee exhausts rights to sickness benefits under subsection
      (c) of this section.

      (2) The daily benefit rate with respect to any such employee for
    such day of unemployment or sickness shall be in an amount equal to
    60 per centum of the daily rate of compensation for the employee's
    last employment in which he engaged for an employer in the base
    year, but not less than $12.70: Provided, however, That for
    registration periods beginning after June 30, 1975, but before July
    1, 1976, such amount shall not exceed $24 per day of such
    unemployment or sickness, that for registration periods beginning
    after June 30, 1976, but before July 1, 1988, such amount shall not
    exceed $25 per day of such unemployment or sickness, that for
    registration periods beginning after June 30, 1988, but before July
    1, 1989, such amount shall not exceed $30 per day of unemployment
    or sickness, and that for registration periods beginning after June
    30, 1989, such amount shall not exceed the maximum daily benefit
    rate provided in paragraph (3) of this subsection. The daily rate
    of compensation referred to in this paragraph shall be determined
    by the Board on the basis of information furnished to the Board by
    the employee, his employer, or both.
      (3) The maximum daily benefit rate computed by the Board under
    section 362(r)(2) of this title shall be the product of the monthly
    compensation base, as computed under section 351(i)(2) of this
    title for the base year immediately preceding the beginning of the
    benefit year, multiplied by 5 percent. If the maximum daily benefit
    rate so computed is not a multiple of $1, it shall be rounded down
    to the nearest multiple of $1.
      (4) In computing benefits to be paid, days of unemployment shall
    not be combined with days of sickness in the same registration
    period.
    (b) Time of payments
      The benefits provided for in this section shall be paid to an
    employee at such reasonable intervals as the Board may prescribe.
    (c) Maximum number of days for benefits
      (1) Normal benefits
        (A) Generally
          The maximum number of days of unemployment within a benefit
        year for which benefits may be paid to an employee shall be
        130, and the maximum number of days of sickness within a
        benefit year for which benefits may be paid to an employee
        shall be 130.
        (B) Limitation
          The total amount of benefits that may be paid to an employee
        for days of unemployment within a benefit year shall in no case
        exceed the employee's compensation in the base year; and the
        total amount of benefits that may be paid to an employee for
        days of sickness within a benefit year shall in no case exceed
        the employee's compensation in the base year, except that
        notwithstanding section 351(i) of this title, in determining
        the employee's compensation in the base year for the purpose of
        this sentence, any money remuneration paid to the employee for
        services rendered as an employee shall be taken into account
        that is not in excess of an amount that bears the same ratio to
        $775 as the monthly compensation base for that year as computed
        under section 351(i) of this title bears to $600.
      (2) Extended benefits
        (A) Generally
          With respect to an employee who has 10 or more years of
        service as defined in section 231(f) of this title, who did not
        voluntarily retire and (in a case involving exhaustion of
        rights to normal benefits for days of unemployment) did not
        voluntarily leave work without good cause, and who had current
        rights to normal benefits for days of unemployment or days of
        sickness in a benefit year but has exhausted such rights, the
        benefit year in which such rights are exhausted shall be deemed
        not to be ended until the last day of the extended benefit
        period determined under this paragraph, and extended
        unemployment benefits or extended sickness benefits (depending
        on the type of normal benefit rights exhausted) may be paid for
        not more than 65 days of unemployment or 65 days of sickness
        within such extended benefit period.
        (B) Beginning date
          An employee's extended benefit period shall begin on the
        employee's first day of unemployment or first day of sickness,
        as the case may be, following the day on which the employee
        exhausts the employee's then current rights to normal benefits
        for days of unemployment or days of sickness and shall continue
        for 7 consecutive 14-day periods, each of which shall
        constitute a registration period, but no such extended benefit
        period shall extend beyond the beginning of the first
        registration period in a benefit year in which the employee is
        again qualified for benefits in accordance with section 353 of
        this title on the basis of compensation earned after the first
        of such consecutive 14-day periods has begun.
        (C) Termination when employee reaches age of 65
          Notwithstanding any other provision of this paragraph, an
        extended benefit period for sickness benefits shall terminate
        on the day next preceding the date on which the employee
        attains age 65, except that it may continue for the purpose of
        paying benefits for days of unemployment.
        (D) Temporary increase in extended unemployment benefits
          (i) Employees with 10 or more years of service
            Subject to clause (iii), in the case of an employee who has
          10 or more years of service (as so defined), with respect to
          extended unemployment benefits - 
              (I) subparagraph (A) shall be applied by substituting
            "130 days of unemployment" for "65 days of unemployment";
            and
              (II) subparagraph (B) shall be applied by inserting "(or,
            in the case of unemployment benefits, 13 consecutive 14-day
            periods)" after "7 consecutive 14-day periods".
          (ii) Employees with less than 10 years of service
            Subject to clause (iii), in the case of an employee who has
          less than 10 years of service (as so defined), with respect
          to extended unemployment benefits, this paragraph shall apply
          to such an employee in the same manner as this paragraph
          would apply to an employee described in clause (i) if such
          clause had not been enacted.
          (iii) Application
            The provisions of clauses (i) and (ii) shall apply to an
          employee who received normal benefits for days of
          unemployment under this chapter during the period beginning
          July 1, 2008, and ending on June 30, 2010, except that no
          extended benefit period under this paragraph shall begin
          after December 31, 2010. Notwithstanding the preceding
          sentence, no benefits shall be payable under this
          subparagraph and clauses (i) and (ii) shall no longer be
          applicable upon the exhaustion of the funds appropriated
          under clause (iv) for payment of benefits under this
          subparagraph.
          (iv) Appropriation
            Out of any funds in the Treasury not otherwise
          appropriated, there are appropriated $20,000,000 to cover the
          cost of additional extended unemployment benefits provided
          under this subparagraph, to remain available until expended.
          In addition to the amount appropriated by the preceding
          sentence, out of any funds in the Treasury not otherwise
          appropriated, there are appropriated $175,000,000 to cover
          the cost of additional extended unemployment benefits
          provided under this subparagraph, to remain available until
          expended.
      (3) Accelerated benefits
        (A) General rule
          With respect to an employee who has 10 or more years of
        service as defined in section 231(f) of this title, who did not
        voluntarily retire, and (in a case involving unemployment
        benefits) did not voluntarily leave work without good cause,
        who has 14 or more consecutive days of unemployment, or 14 or
        more consecutive days of sickness, and who is not a qualified
        employee with respect to the general benefit year current when
        such unemployment or sickness commences but is or becomes a
        qualified employee for the next succeeding general benefit
        year, such succeeding general benefit year shall, in that
        employee's case, begin on the first day of the month in which
        such unemployment or sickness commences.
        (B) Exception
          In the case of a succeeding benefit year beginning in
        accordance with subparagraph (A) by reason of sickness, such
        sentence shall not operate to permit the payment of benefits in
        the period provided for in such sentence for any day of
        sickness beginning with the date on which the employee attains
        age 65, and continuing through the day preceding the first day
        of the next succeeding general benefit year.
        (C) Determination of age
          For the purposes of this subsection, the Board may rely on
        evidence of age available in its records and files at the time
        determinations of age are made.
    (d) Overpayment of benefits; recovery; liability of officers
      If the Board finds that at any time more than the correct amount
    of benefits has been paid to any individual under this chapter or a
    payment has been made to an individual not entitled thereto
    (including payments made prior to July 1, 1940), recovery by
    adjustments in subsequent payments to which such individual is
    entitled under this chapter or any other Act administered by the
    Board may, except as otherwise provided in this subsection, be made
    under regulations prescribed by the Board. If such individual dies
    before recovery is completed, recovery may be made by set-off or
    adjustments, under regulations prescribed by the Board, in
    subsequent payments due, under this chapter or any other Act
    administered by the Board, to the estate, designee, next of kin,
    legal representative, or surviving spouse of such individual, with
    respect to the employment of such individual.
      Adjustments under this subsection may be made either by
    deductions from subsequent payments or, with respect to payments
    which are to be made during a lifetime or lifetimes, by subtracting
    the total amount of benefits paid in excess of the proper amount
    from the actuarial value, as determined by the Board, of such
    payments to be made during a lifetime or lifetimes and recertifying
    such payments on the basis of the reduced actuarial value. In the
    latter case, recovery shall be deemed to have been completed upon
    such recertification.
      There shall be no recovery in any case in which more than the
    correct amount of benefits has been paid to an individual or
    payment has been made to an individual not entitled thereto
    (including payments made prior to July 1, 1940) who, in the
    judgment of the Board, is without fault when, in the judgment of
    the Board, recovery would be contrary to the purpose of this
    chapter or would be against equity or good conscience.
      No certifying or disbursing officer shall be held liable for any
    amount certified or paid by him in good faith to any person where
    the recovery of such amount is waived under the third paragraph of
    this subsection or has been begun but cannot be completed under the
    first paragraph of this subsection.
    (e) Assignment, taxation, garnishment, attachment, etc., of
      benefits
      Notwithstanding any other law of the United States, or of any
    State, Territory, or the District of Columbia, no benefits shall be
    assignable or be subject to any tax or to garnishment, attachment,
    or other legal process under any circumstances whatsoever, nor
    shall the payment thereof be anticipated.
    (f) Effect of payment of benefits for remunerable period; payment
      of surplus remuneration to Board
      If (i) benefits are paid to any employee with respect to
    unemployment or sickness in any registration period, and it is
    later determined that remuneration is payable to such employee with
    respect to any period which includes days in such registration
    period which had been determined to be days of unemployment or
    sickness, and (ii) the person or company from which such
    remuneration is payable has, before payment thereof, notice of the
    payment of benefits upon the basis of days of unemployment or
    sickness included in such period, the remuneration so payable shall
    not be reduced by reason of such benefits but the remuneration so
    payable, to the extent to which benefits were paid upon the basis
    of days which had been determined to be days of unemployment or
    sickness and which are included in the period for which such
    remuneration is payable, shall be held to be a special fund in
    trust for the Board. The amount of such special fund shall be paid
    to the Board and in the collection thereof the Board shall have the
    same authority, and the same penalties shall apply, as are provided
    in section 358 of this title with respect to contributions. The
    proceeds of such special fund shall be credited to the account.
    Such benefits, to the extent that they are represented in such a
    special fund which has been collected by the Board, shall be
    disregarded for the purposes of subsection (c) of this section.
    (g) Payment of accrued benefits upon death
      Benefits accrued to an individual but not yet paid at death
    shall, upon certification by the Board, be paid, without necessity
    of filing further claims therefor, to the same individual or
    individuals to whom any accrued annuities under section 231e(a)(1)
    of this title are paid. In the event that no such accrued annuities
    are paid, and if application for such accrued benefits is filed
    prior to the expiration of two years after the death of the
    individual to whom such benefits accrued, such accrued benefits
    shall be paid, upon certification by the Board, to the individual
    or individuals who would be entitled thereto under section
    231e(a)(1) of this title if such accrued benefits were accrued
    annuities. If there is no individual to whom all or any part of
    such accrued benefits can be paid in accordance with the foregoing
    provisions, such benefits or part thereof shall escheat to the

      There shall not be considered as a day of unemployment, or as a
    day of sickness, with respect to any employee - 
        (i) any of the seventy-five days beginning with the first day
      of any registration period with respect to which the Board finds
      that he knowingly made or aided in making or caused to be made
      any false or fraudulent statement or claim for the purpose of
      causing benefits to be paid;
        (ii) any day in any period with respect to which the Board
      finds that he is receiving or will have received annuity payments
      under the Railroad Retirement Act of 1974 [45 U.S.C. 231 et
      seq.], or insurance benefits under title II of the Social
      Security Act [42 U.S.C. 401 et seq.], or unemployment, maternity,
      or sickness benefits under an unemployment, maternity, or
      sickness compensation law other than this chapter, or any other
      social-insurance payments under any law: Provided, That if an
      employee receives or is held entitled to receive any such
      payments, other than unemployment, maternity, or sickness
      payments, with respect to any period which include days of
      unemployment or sickness in a registration period, after benefits
      under this chapter for such registration period will have been
      paid, the amount by which such benefits under this chapter will
      have been increased by including such days as days of
      unemployment or as days of sickness shall be recoverable by the
      Board: Provided further, That, if that part of any such payment
      or payments, other than unemployment, maternity, or sickness
      payments, which is apportionable to such days of unemployment or
      days of sickness is less in amount than the benefits under this
      chapter which, but for this paragraph, would be payable and not
      recoverable with respect to such days of unemployment or days of
      sickness, the preceding provisions of this paragraph shall not
      apply but such benefits under this chapter for such days of
      unemployment or days of sickness shall be diminished or
      recoverable in the amount of such part of such other payment or
      payments;
        (iii) if he is paid a separation allowance, any of the days in
      the period beginning with the day following his separation from
      service and continuing for that number of consecutive fourteen-
      day periods which is equal, or most nearly equal, to the amount
      of the separation allowance divided (i) by ten times his last
      daily rate of compensation prior to his separation if he normally
      works five days a week, (ii) by twelve times such rate if he
      normally works six days a week, and (iii) by fourteen times such
      rate if he normally works seven days a week; (!1)

    of the days in the period beginning with the day with respect to

    until he has been paid compensation of not less than $1,500 with
    respect to time after the beginning of such period and before 1989
    or, if any part of such compensation is paid in a calendar year
    after 1988, not less than an amount that is equal to 2.5 times the
    monthly compensation base for months in such calendar year, as
    computed under section 351(i) of this title;
      (B) if the Board finds that he left work voluntarily with good
    cause, the provisions of subdivision (A) shall not apply, with
    respect to him, to any day in a registration period if such period
    does not include any day which is in a period for which he could
    receive benefits under an unemployment compensation law other than
    this chapter, and he so certifies. Such certification shall, in the
    absence of evidence to the contrary, be accepted subject to the
    penalty provisions of section 359(a) of this title;
      (ii) any of the thirty days beginning with the day with respect
    to which the Board finds that he failed, without good cause, to
    accept suitable work available on such day and offered to him, or
    to comply with instructions from the Board requiring him to apply
    for suitable work or to report, in person or by mail as the Board
    may require, to an employment office;
      (iii) subject to the provisions of subsection (b) of this
    section, any day with respect to which the Board finds that his
    unemployment was due to a stoppage of work because of a strike in
    the establishment, premises, or enterprise at which he was last
    employed, and the Board finds that such strike was commenced in
    violation of the provisions of the Railway Labor Act [45 U.S.C. 151
    et seq.] or in violation of the established rules and practices of
    a bona fide labor organization of which he was a member.
    (b) Participation, interest, or financial assistance in labor
      dispute
      The disqualification provided in subsection (a-2)(iii) of this
    section shall not apply if the Board finds that - 
        (i) the employee is not participating in or financing or
      directly interested in the strike which causes the stoppage of
      work: Provided, That payment of regular union dues shall not be
      construed to constitute financing a strike or direct interest in
      a strike within the meaning of this and the following paragraphs;
      and
        (ii) he does not belong to a grade or class of workers of
      which, immediately before the commencement of the stoppage, there
      were members employed in the establishment, premises, or
      enterprise at which the stoppage occurs, any of whom are
      participating in or financing or directly interested in the
      dispute: Provided, That if separate types of work are commonly
      conducted in separate departments of a single enterprise, each
      such department shall, for the purposes of this subsection, be
      deemed to be a separate establishment, enterprise, or other
      premises.
    (c) Unsuitable work
      No work shall be deemed suitable for the purposes of subsection
    (a-2)(ii) of this section, and benefits shall not be denied under
    this chapter to any otherwise qualified employee for refusing to
    accept work if - 
        (i) the position offered is vacant due directly to a strike,
      lockout, or other labor dispute;
        (ii) the remuneration, hours, or other conditions of work
      offered are substantially less favorable to the employee than
      those prevailing for similar work in the locality, or the rate of
      remuneration is less than the union wage rate, if any, for
      similar work in the locality;
        (iii) as a condition of being employed he would be required to
      join a company union or to resign from or refrain from joining
      any bona fide labor organization;
        (iv) acceptance of the work would require him to engage in
      activities in violation of law or which, by reason of their being
      in violation of reasonable requirements of the constitution,
      bylaws, or similar regulations of a bona fide labor organization
      of which he is a member, would subject him to expulsion from such
      labor organization; or
        (v) acceptance of the work would subject him to loss of
      substantial seniority rights under any collective bargaining
      agreement between a railway labor organization, organized in
      accordance with the provisions of the Railway Labor Act [45
      U.S.C. 151 et seq.], and any other employer.
    (d) Factors in determination of suitable work
      In determining, within the limitations of subsection (c) of this
    section, whether or not any work is suitable for an employee for
    the purposes of subsection (a-2)(ii) of this section, the Board
    shall consider, in addition to such other factors as it deems
    relevant, (i) the current practices recognized by management and
    labor with respect to such work; (ii) the degree of risk involved
    to such employee's health, safety, and morals; (iii) his physical
    fitness and prior training; (iv) his experience and prior earnings;
    (v) his length of unemployment and prospects for securing work in
    his customary occupation; and (vi) the distance of the available
    work from his residence and from his most recent work.
    (e) Voluntarily leaving unsuitable work
      For the purposes of subsection (a-2)(i) of this section, no
    voluntary leaving of work shall be deemed to have been without good
    cause if the Board finds that such work would not have been
    suitable for the purposes of subsection (a-2)(ii) of this section.

    Sec. 355. Claims for benefits

-STATUTE-
    (a) Publication of Board's regulations
      Claims for benefits and appeals from determinations with respect
    thereto shall be made in accordance with such regulations as the
    Board shall prescribe. Each employer shall post and maintain, in
    places readily accessible to employees in his service, such printed
    statements concerning such regulations as the Board supplies to him
    for such purpose, and shall keep available to his employees copies
    of such printed statements. Such printed statements shall be
    supplied by the Board to each employer without cost to him.
    (b) Findings, hearings, investigations, etc., by Board
      The Board is authorized and directed to make findings of fact
    with respect to any claim for benefits and to make decisions as to
    the right of any claimant to benefits. The Board is further
    authorized to hold such hearings, to conduct such investigations
    and other proceedings, and to establish, by regulations or
    otherwise, such procedures as it may deem necessary or proper for
    the determination of a right to benefits. When a claim for benefits
    is filed with the Board, the Board shall provide notice of such
    claim to the claimant's base-year employer or employers and afford
    such employer or employers an opportunity to submit information
    relevant to the claim before making an initial determination on the
    claim. When the Board initially determines to pay benefits to a
    claimant under this chapter, the Board shall provide notice of such
    determination to the claimant's base-year employer or employers.
    (c) Hearing and review of decisions on claims
      (1) Each qualified employee whose claim for benefits has been
    denied in whole or in part upon an initial determination with
    respect thereto upon a basis other than one which is reviewable
    pursuant to one of the succeeding paragraphs of this subsection,
    shall be granted an opportunity for a fair hearing thereon before a
    referee or such other reviewing body as the Board may establish or
    assign thereto. In any such case the Board or the person or
    reviewing body so established or assigned shall, by publication or
    otherwise, notify all parties properly interested of their right to
    participate in the hearing and of the time and place of the
    hearing.
      (2) Any claimant whose claim for benefits has been denied in an
    initial determination with respect thereto upon the basis of his
    not being a qualified employee, and any claimant who contends that
    under an initial determination of his claim he has been awarded
    benefits at less than the proper rate, may appeal to the Board for
    the review of such determination. Thereupon the Board shall review
    the determination and for such review may designate one of its
    officers or employees to receive evidence and to report to the
    Board thereon together with recommendations. In any such case the
    Board or the person so designated shall, by publication or
    otherwise, notify all parties properly interested of their right to
    participate in the proceeding and, if a hearing is to be held, of
    the time and place of the hearing. At the request of any party
    properly interested the Board shall provide for a hearing, and may
    provide for a hearing on its own motion. The Board shall prescribe
    regulations governing the appeals provided for in this paragraph
    and for decisions upon such appeal.
      (3) Any base-year employer of a claimant whose claim for benefits
    has been granted in whole or in part, either in an initial
    determination with respect thereto or in a determination after a
    hearing pursuant to paragraph (1), and who contends that the
    determination is erroneous for a reason or reasons other than a
    reason that is reviewable under paragraph (4), may appeal to the
    Board for review of such determination. Despite such an appeal, the
    benefits awarded shall be paid to such claimant, subject to
    recovery by the Board if and to the extent found on the appeal to
    have been erroneously awarded. The Board shall take such action as
    is appropriate to recover the amount of such benefits including if
    feasible adjustment in subsequent payments pursuant to the first
    two paragraphs of section 352(d) of this title. Upon an appeal, the
    Board shall review the determination appealed from and for such
    review may designate one of its officers or employees to receive
    evidence and report to the Board thereof together with
    recommendations. In any such case the Board or the person so
    designated shall, by publication or otherwise, notify all parties
    properly interested of their right to participate in the proceeding
    and, if a hearing is to be held, of the time and place of the
    hearing. At the request of any party properly interested the Board
    shall provide for a hearing, and may provide for a hearing on its
    own motion. The Board shall prescribe regulations governing the
    appeals provided for in this paragraph and for decisions upon such
    appeal.
      (4) In any case in which benefits are awarded to a claimant in
    whole or in part upon the basis of pay earned in the service of a
    person or company found by the Board to be an employer as defined
    in this chapter but which denies that it is such an employer, such
    benefits awarded on such basis shall be paid to such claimant
    subject to a right of recovery of such benefits. The Board shall
    thereupon designate one of its officers or employees to receive
    evidence and to report to the Board on whether such benefits should
    be repaid. The Board may also designate one of its officers or
    employees to receive evidence and report to the Board whether or
    not any person or company is entitled to a refund of contributions
    or should be required to pay contributions under this chapter,
    regardless of whether or not any claims for benefits will have been
    filed upon the basis of service in the employ of such person or
    company, and shall follow such procedure if contributions are
    assessed and payment is refused or payment is made and a refund
    claimed upon the basis that such person or company is or will not
    have been liable for such contributions. In any such case the Board
    or the person so designated shall, by publication or otherwise,
    notify all parties properly interested of their right to
    participate in the proceeding and, if a hearing is to be held, of
    the time and place of the hearing. At the request of any party
    properly interested the Board shall provide for a hearing, and may
    provide for a hearing on its own motion. The Board shall prescribe
    regulations governing the proceedings provided for in this
    paragraph and for decisions upon such proceedings.
      (5) Final decision of the Board in the cases provided for in the
    preceding three paragraphs shall be communicated to the claimant
    and to the other interested parties within fifteen days after it is
    made. Any properly interested party notified, as hereinabove
    provided, of his right to participate in the proceedings may obtain
    a review of any such decision by which he claims to be aggrieved or
    the determination of any issue therein in the manner provided in
    subsection (f) of this section with respect to the review of the
    Board's decisions upon claims for benefits and subject to all
    provisions of law applicable to the review of such decisions.
    Subject only to such review, the decision of the Board upon all
    issues determined in such decision shall be final and conclusive
    for all purposes and shall conclusively establish all rights and
    obligations, arising under this chapter, of every party notified as
    hereinabove provided of his right to participate in the
    proceedings.
      (6) For purposes of this subsection and subsections (d) and (f)
    of this section, any base-year employer of the claimant is a
    properly interested party.
      (7) Any issue determinable pursuant to this subsection and
    subsection (f) of this section shall not be determined in any
    manner other than pursuant to this subsection and subsection (f) of
    this section.
    (d) Decisions of reviewing bodies; review and finality
      The Board shall prescribe regulations governing the filing of
    cases with and the decision of cases by reviewing bodies, and the
    review of such decisions. The Board may provide for intermediate
    reviews of such decisions by such bodies as the Board may establish
    or assign thereto. The Board may (i) on its own motion review a
    decision of an intermediate reviewing body on the basis of the
    evidence previously submitted in such case, and may direct the
    taking of additional evidence, or (ii) permit such parties as it
    finds properly interested in the proceedings to take appeals to the
    Board. Unless a review or an appeal is had pursuant to this
    subsection, the decision of an intermediate reviewing body shall,
    subject to such regulations as the Board may prescribe, be deemed
    to be the final decision of the Board.
    (e) Application of rules of evidence in law and equity; notice of
      findings
      In any proceeding other than a court proceeding, the rules of
    evidence prevailing in courts of law or equity shall not be
    controlling, but a full and complete record shall be kept of all
    proceedings and testimony, and the Board's final determination,
    together with its findings of fact and conclusions of law in
    connection therewith, shall be communicated to the parties within
    fifteen days after the date of such final determination.
    (f) Review of final decision of Board by Courts of Appeals; costs
      Any claimant, or any railway labor organization organized in
    accordance with the provisions of the Railway Labor Act [45 U.S.C.
    151 et seq.], of which claimant is a member, or any base-year
    employer of the claimant, or any other party aggrieved by a final
    decision under subsection (c) of this section, may, only after all
    administrative remedies within the Board will have been availed of
    and exhausted, obtain a review of any final decision of the Board
    by filing a petition for review within ninety days after the
    mailing of notice of such decision to the claimant or other party,
    or within such further time as the Board may allow, in the United
    States court of appeals for the circuit in which the claimant or
    other party resides or will have had his principal place of
    business or principal executive office, or in the United States
    Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit or in the United States
    Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. A copy of such
    petition, together with initial process, shall forth-with be served
    upon the Board or any officer designated by it for such purpose. A
    copy of such petition also shall forthwith be served upon any other
    properly interested party, and such party shall be a party to the
    review proceeding. Service may be made upon the Board by registered
    mail addressed to the Chairman. Within thirty days after receipt of
    service, or within such additional time as the court may allow, the
    Board shall file with the court in which such petition has been
    filed the record upon which the findings and decision complained of
    are based, as provided in section 2112 of title 28. Upon the filing
    of such petition the court shall have exclusive jurisdiction of the
    proceeding and of the question determined therein. It shall have
    power to enter a decree affirming, modifying, or reversing the
    decision of the Board, with or without remanding the cause for
    rehearing. The findings of the Board as to the facts, if supported
    by evidence and in the absence of fraud, shall be conclusive. No
    additional evidence shall be received by the court but the court
    may order additional evidence to be taken before the Board, and the
    Board may, after hearing such additional evidence, modify its
    findings of fact and conclusions and file such additional or
    modified findings and conclusions with the court, and the Board
    shall file with the court the additional record. The judgment and
    decree of the court shall be final, subject to review as in equity
    cases.
      An applicant for review of a final decision of the Board
    concerning a claim for benefits shall not be liable for costs,
    including costs of service, or costs of printing records, except
    that costs may be assessed by the court against such applicant if
    the court determines that the proceedings for such review have been
    instituted or continued without reasonable ground.
    (g) Finality of Board decisions
      Findings of fact and conclusions of law of the Board in the
    determination of any claim for benefits or refund, the
    determination of any other matter pursuant to subsection (c) of
    this section, and the determination of the Board that the
    unexpended funds in the account are available for the payment of
    any claim for benefits or refund under this chapter, shall be,
    except as provided in subsection (f) of this section, binding and
    conclusive for all purposes and upon all persons, including the
    Comptroller General and any other administrative or accounting
    officer, employee, or agent of the United States, and shall not be
    subject to review in any manner other than that set forth in
    subsection (f) of this section.
    (h) Benefits payable prior to final decision of Board
      Except as may be otherwise prescribed by regulations of the
    Board, benefits payable with respect to any period prior to the
    date of a final decision of the Board with respect to a claim
    therefor, shall be paid only after such final decision.
    (i) Fees for presenting claims; penalties
      No claimant or other properly interested person claiming benefits
    shall be charged fees of any kind by the Board, its employees or
    representatives, with respect to such claim. Any such claimant or
    other properly interested person may be represented by counsel or
    other duly authorized agent, in any proceeding before the Board or
    its representatives or a court, but no such counsel or agent for a
    claimant shall either charge or receive for such services more than
    an amount approved by the Board or by the court before whom the
    proceedings of the Board are reviewed. Any person who violates any
    provision of this subsection shall be punished by a fine of not
    more than $10,000 or by imprisonment not exceeding one year.

-HEAD-
    Sec. 356. Returns of compensation; conclusiveness; failure to make

-STATUTE-
      Employers shall file with the Board, in such manner and at such
    times as the Board by regulations may prescribe, returns of
    compensation of employees, and, if the Board shall so require,
    shall distribute to employees annual statements of compensation:
    Provided, That no returns shall be required of employers which
    would duplicate information contained in similar returns required
    under any other Act of Congress administered by the Board. The
    Board's record of the compensation so returned shall, for the
    purpose of determining eligibility for and the amount of benefits,
    be conclusive as to the amount of compensation paid to an employee
    during the period covered by the return, and the fact that the
    Board's records show that no return was made of the compensation
    claimed to have been paid to an employee during a particular period
    shall, for the purposes of determining eligibility for and the
    amount of benefits, be taken as conclusive that no compensation was
    paid to such employee during that period, unless the error in the
    amount of compensation in the one case, or failure to make or
    record return of the compensation in the other case, is called to
    the attention of the Board within eighteen months after the date on
    which the last return covering any portion of the calendar year
    which includes such period is required to have been made.

    Sec. 358. Contributions

-STATUTE-
    (a) Employer contribution
      (1) In general
        (A) General rule
          (i) Contribution rate generally
            Every employer shall pay a contribution, with respect to
          having employees in his service, equal to the percentage
          determined under subparagraph (B), (C), or (D), whichever is
          applicable, of so much of the compensation paid in any
          calendar month by such employer to any employee as is not in
          excess of the monthly compensation base for that month as
          computed under section 351(i) of this title.
          (ii) Multiple employer limitation
            If compensation is paid to an employee by more than one
          employer in any calendar month - 
              (I) the contributions required by this subsection shall
            not apply to any amount of the aggregate compensation paid
            to such employee by all such employers in such calendar
            month which is in excess of such monthly compensation base;
            and
              (II) each employer (other than a subordinate unit of a
            national-railway-labor-organization employer) shall be
            liable for that portion of the contribution with respect to
            such compensation paid by all such employers which the
            compensation paid by him to such employee bears to the
            total compensation paid in such month by all such employers
            to such employee.

          In the event that the compensation paid by such employers to
          the employee in such month is less than such monthly
          compensation base, each subordinate unit of a national-
          railway-labor-organization employer shall be liable for such
          portion of any additional contribution as the compensation
          paid by such employer to such employee in such month bears to
          the total compensation paid by all such employers to such
          employee in such month.
        (B) Transitional rule
          (i) 1st, 2d, and 3d calendar years
            Except as provided in clause (vi), with respect to
          compensation paid in calendar years 1988, 1989, and 1990, the
          contribution rate shall be 8 percent.
          (ii) 4th calendar year
            With respect to compensation paid in calendar year 1991,
          the contribution rate shall be the smaller of - 
              (I) the maximum contribution limit computed under
            paragraph (20); or
              (II) the percentage computed pursuant to the following
            formula:


                                 2A+B                       
                           R = ---------                     
                                   3                       
    
    
          (iii) 5th calendar year
            With respect to compensation paid in calendar year 1992,
          the contribution rate shall be the smaller of - 
              (I) the maximum contribution limit computed under
            paragraph (20); or
              (II) the percentage computed pursuant to the following
            formula:


                                 A+2C                       
                           R = ---------                       
                                   3                       


          (iv) Meaning of symbols
            For purposes of the formulas in clauses (ii) and (iii) - 
              (I) "R" is the applicable contribution rate expressed as
            a percentage for months in the calendar year;
              (II) "A" is the contribution rate determined under clause
            (i);
              (III) "B" is the percentage rate for the employer, as
            determined under subparagraph (C), for calendar year 1991;
            and
              (IV) "C" is the percentage rate for the employer, as
            determined under subparagraph (C), for calendar year 1992.
          (v) Special rule for certain computations
            For purposes of computing B and C in such formulas - 
              (I) the percentage rate computed under subparagraph (C),
            if more than the maximum contribution limit computed under
            paragraph (20) shall not be reduced to that limit; and
              (II) any computations which under subparagraph (C) are to
            be made on the basis of a 4-quarter or a 12-quarter period
            ending on a given June 30 shall be made on the basis of a
            period beginning on January 1, 1990, and ending on that
            June 30, and the amount so computed shall be increased to
            an amount that bears the same ratio to the amount so
            computed as 4 or 12, as appropriate, bears to the number of
            calendar quarters in the period on which the computation
            was based.
          (vi) Special transition rule for public commuter railroads
            With respect to each of calendar years 1989 and 1990, the
          contribution of the National Railroad Passenger Corporation
          and an employer which on November 10, 1988, is a publicly
          funded and publicly operated carrier providing rail commuter
          service shall be equal to the amount of benefits attributable
          to such carrier, plus an amount equal to 0.65 percent of the
          total compensation paid by that employer in that year on
          which that employer's contribution would be based under
          clause (i) if such employer's contribution were determined
          under that clause.
        (C) Experience-rated contributions
          With respect to compensation paid in a calendar year that
        begins after December 31, 1992, the contribution rate for each
        employer shall be determined as follows:
          (i) Step 1
            Compute the employer's benefit ratio as of the preceding
          June 30 to 4 decimal points in accordance with paragraph (2).
          (ii) Step 2
            Subtract the employer's reserve ratio as of the preceding
          June 30 as computed to 4 decimal points in accordance with
          paragraph (4).
          (iii) Step 3
            Subtract the pooled credit ratio for the calendar year, if
          any, as computed to 4 decimal points in accordance with
          paragraph (12).
          (iv) Step 4
            Multiply by 100 the total arrived at under the steps set
          forth in clauses (i) through (iii) so as to obtain a
          percentage rate, which shall be rounded to the nearest 100th
          of 1 percent. If the total arrived at under such steps is 0
          or less than 0, the percentage rate as so computed shall be
          0.
          (v) Step 5
            Add 0.65 to the percentage rate arrived at under clause
          (iv), representing the portion of the employer's contribution
          which is to be deposited to the credit of the fund under
          subsection (i) of this section.
          (vi) Step 6
            Add the surcharge rate for the calendar year, if any, as
          computed under paragraph (14).
          (vii) Step 7
            Add the pooled charge ratio for the calendar year, if any,
          as computed to 4 decimal points under paragraph (13) and
          multiplied by 100.
          (viii) Step 8
            Reduce the precentage (!1) rate computed in accordance with
          the preceding steps to the maximum contribution limit
          computed under paragraph (20), if such rate is higher than
          such limit. The rate computed in accordance with the
          preceding steps, after any reduction under this clause, is
          the contribution rate.

        (D) New-employer contribution rates
          Notwithstanding subparagraphs (B) and (C), the contribution
        rate applicable to a new employer who does not become subject
        to this chapter until after December 31, 1989, shall be
        determined as follows:
          (i) 1st calendar year
            With respect to compensation paid in calendar months before
          the end of the first full calendar year in which the employer
          is subject to this chapter, the contribution rate shall be
          the average contribution rate paid by all employers during
          the 3 calendar years preceding the calendar year before the
          calendar year in which the compensation is paid. The average
          contribution rate shall be determined - 
              (I) by dividing the aggregate contributions paid by all
            employers under this subsection in those 3 calendar years
            by the aggregate compensation with respect to which such
            contributions were paid; and
              (II) by multiplying the resulting ratio as computed to 4
            decimal points by 100.
          (ii) 2d calendar year
            With respect to compensation paid in calendar months in the
          next calendar year, the contribution rate shall be the
          smaller of - 
              (I) the maximum contribution limit computed under
            paragraph (20); or
              (II) the percentage rate computed pursuant to the
            following formula:


                                      2(A2)+B                        
                             R = (--------------)                  
                                         3                        


          (iii) 3d calendar year
            With respect to compensation paid in calendar months in the
          third full calendar year in which the employer is subject to
          the coverage of this chapter, the contribution rate shall be
          the smaller of - 
              (I) the maximum contribution limit computed under
            paragraph (20); or
              (II) the percentage rate computed pursuant to the
            following formula:


                                      A3+2C                       
                              R = ---------------                       
                                         3                       


          (iv) Subsequent calendar years
            With respect to all calendar months in calendar years
          subsequent to that calendar year, the contribution rate shall
          be determined under subparagraph (C).
          (v) Meaning of symbols
            For purposes of the formulas in clauses (ii) and (iii) - 
              (I) "R" is the applicable contribution rate expressed as
            a percentage for months in the calendar year;
              (II) "A1" is the contribution rate determined under
            clause (i) for such employer's first full calendar year;
              (III) "A2" is the contribution rate which would have been
            determined under clause (i) if the employer's second
            calendar year had been its first full calendar year;
              (IV) "A3" is the contribution rate which would have been
            determined under clause (i) if the employer's third
            calendar year had been such employer's first full calendar
            year;
              (V) "B" is the contribution rate for the employer as
            determined under subparagraph (C) for the employer's second
            full calendar year; and
              (VI) "C" is the contribution rate for the employer as
            determined under subparagraph (C) for the employer's third
            full calendar year.
          (vi) Special rule for certain computations
            For purposes of computing B and C in such formulas - 
              (I) the percentage rate computed under subparagraph (C),
            shall not be reduced under clause (viii) of that
            subparagraph; and
              (II) any computations which under subparagraph (C) are to
            be made on the basis of a 4-quarter or 12-quarter period
            ending on a given June 30 shall be made on the basis of a
            period commencing with the first day of the first calendar
            quarter that begins after the date on which the employer
            first commenced paying compensation subject to this chapter
            and ending on that June 30, and the amount so computed
            shall be increased to an amount that bears the same ratio
            to the amount so computed as 4 or 12, as appropriate, bears
            to the number of calendar quarters in the period on which
            the computation was based.
      (2) Benefit ratio
        An employer's benefit ratio as of any given June 30 shall be
      determined by dividing all benefits charged to the employer under
      paragraph (15) during the 12 calendar quarters ending on such
      June 30 by the employer's 3-year compensation base as of such
      June 30 as computed under paragraph (3).
      (3) 3-year compensation base
        An employer's 3-year compensation base as of any given June 30
      is the aggregate compensation with respect to which contributions
      were paid by the employer under this subsection in the 12
      calendar quarters ending on such June 30.
      (4) Reserve ratio
        An employer's reserve ratio as of any given June 30 shall be
      computed by dividing the employer's reserve balance as of such
      June 30, as computed under paragraph (6), by that employer's 1-
      year compensation base as of such June 30, as computed under
      paragraph (5). The employer's reserve ratio may be either a
      positive or a negative figure, depending upon whether the
      employer's reserve balance is a positive or negative figure.
      (5) 1-year compensation base
        An employer's 1-year compensation base as of any given June 30
      is the aggregate compensation with respect to which contributions
      were paid by the employer under this subsection in the 4 calendar
      quarters ending on such June 30.
      (6) Reserve balance
        An employer's reserve balance as of any given June 30 shall be
      determined by subtracting the employer's cumulative benefit
      balance as of such June 30, computed under paragraph (7), from
      the employer's net cumulative contribution balance as of such
      June 30, computed under paragraph (8). An employer's reserve
      balance may be either positive or negative, depending upon
      whether or not that employer's net cumulative contribution
      balance exceeds the employer's cumulative benefit balance.
      (7) Cumulative benefit balance
        An employer's cumulative benefit balance as of any given June
      30 shall be determined by adding - 
          (A) the net amount of the benefits charged to the employer
        under paragraph (15) on or after January 1, 1990; and
          (B) the cumulative amount of the employer's unallocated
        charges for the same period, if any, as computed under
        paragraph (9).
      (8) Net cumulative contribution balance
        An employer's net cumulative contribution balance as of any
      given June 30 shall be determined as follows:
        (A) Step 1
          Compute the sum of
            (i) all contributions paid by the employer pursuant to this
          subsection;
            (ii) that portion of the tax imposed under section 3321(a)
          of title 26 that is attributable to the surtax rate under
          section 516(b) of the Railroad Unemployment Insurance and
          Retirement Improvement Act of 1988; (!2) and

            (iii) any taxes paid by the employer pursuant to section
          3321(a) of title 26 (after the outstanding balance of loans
          made under section 360(d) of this title before October 1,
          1985, plus interest, have been paid);

        on or after January 1, 1990.
        (B) Step 2
          Subtract an amount equal to the amount of such contributions
        deposited to the credit of the fund under subsection (i) of
        this section.
        (C) Step 3
          Add an amount equal to the aggregate amount by which such
        contributions were reduced in prior calendar years as a result
        of pooled credits, if any, under paragraph (1)(C)(iii).
      (9) Unallocated charge
        An employer's unallocated charge as of any given June 30 is the
      amount that as of such June 30 bears the same ratio to the system
      unallocated charge balance, computed under paragraph (10), as the
      employer's 1-year compensation base, computed under paragraph
      (5), bears to the system compensation base computed under
      paragraph (11).
      (10) System unallocated charge balance
        The system unallocated charge balance as of any given June 30
      shall be determined as follows:
        (A) Step 1
          Compute the aggregate amount of all interest paid by the
        account on loans from the Railroad Retirement Account after
        September 30, 1985, pursuant to section 360(d) of this title,
        during the 4 calendar quarters ending on that June 30.
        (B) Step 2
          Add the aggregate amount of any additions to the system
        unallocated charge balance specified in paragraphs (15) and
        (16), during that period.
        (C) Step 3
          Add the aggregate amount of any other expenditures by the
        account during that period not chargeable to any individual
        employer under paragraph (15) or to the fund under section 361
        of this title.
        (D) Step 4
          Subtract the aggregate amount of all income to the account,
        under section 360(a)(iv) of this title or section 360(a)(vii)
        of this title, during that period.
        (E) Step 5
          Subtract the aggregate amount of all transfers to the
        account, pursuant to section 361(d) of this title, during that
        period.
        (F) Step 6
          Subtract the aggregate amount of all other income and
        receipts of the account, during that period, which are not
        assigned to individual employer balances.
        (G) Step 7
          Subtract the net cumulative contribution balance of each
        employer whose balance has been cancelled pursuant to paragraph
        (16), during that period, calculated as of the date of such
        cancellation.
      (11) System compensation base
        The system compensation base as of any given June 30 shall be
      determined by adding together the amounts of the 1-year
      compensation bases of all employers and employee representatives
      subject to this chapter, computed in accordance with paragraph
      (5), as of such June 30.
      (12) Pooled credit ratio
        The pooled credit ratio, if any, for a calendar year shall be
      determined as follows:
        (A) Step 1
          Compute the balance to the credit of the account as of the
        close of business on the preceding June 30, including any
        amounts in the account attributable to loans made under section
        360(d) of this title before October 1, 1985, but disregarding
        the obligation to repay such loans and interest thereon. In
        determining such balance as of June 30 of any year, so much of
        the balance to the credit of the railroad unemployment
        insurance administration fund as of the close of business on
        such date as is in excess of $6,000,000 shall be deemed to be
        part of the balance to the credit of such account. There will
        be a pooled credit ratio for the calendar year only if that
        balance is in excess of the greater of $250,000,000 or of the
        amount that bears the same ratio to $250,000,000 as the system
        compensation base as of that June 30 bears to the system
        compensation base as of June 30, 1991, as computed in
        accordance with paragraph (11).
        (B) Step 2
          If there is such an excess amount, divide that excess amount
        by the system compensation base as of the June 30 preceding the
        calendar year. The result is the pooled credit ratio for the
        calendar year.
      (13) Pooled charge ratio
        The pooled charge ratio, if any, for a calendar year shall be
      determined as follows:
        (A) Step 1
          With respect to each employer whose contribution rate for
        that calendar year as computed through step 6 under paragraph
        (1)(C) was greater than the maximum contribution limit computed
        under paragraph (20), multiply the employer's 1-year
        compensation base as of the preceding June 30, as computed in
        accordance with paragraph (5), by the difference between - 
            (i) the percentage rate determined under subparagraph (B),
          (C), or (D) of paragraph (1) before the reduction to the
          maximum contribution limit; and
            (ii) the maximum contribution limit.
        (B) Step 2
          Add the amounts arrived at under step 1 so as to obtain an
        aggregate amount for all such employers.
        (C) Step 3
          For each employer whose contribution rate as computed through
        step 3 under paragraph (1)(C) was less than 0, the percentage
        rate by which such employer's rate was raised in order to bring
        that rate to 0 shall be multiplied by that employer's 1-year
        compensation base as of the preceding June 30. Subtract the
        total of the amounts computed under the preceding sentence for
        all employers from the amount arrived at in step 2.
        (D) Step 4
          Divide the aggregate amount arrived at under step 3 by the
        system compensation base as of the preceding June 30 as
        computed under paragraph (11) minus the one-year compensation
        base of those employers whose rates computed through step 6 of
        paragraph (1)(C) exceeded the maximum contribution rate
        computed under paragraph (20). The result is the pooled charge
        ratio for the calendar year.
      (14) Surcharge rate
        The surcharge rate for a calendar year, if any, shall be
      determined as follows:
        (A) Step 1
          Compute the balance to the credit of the account as of the
        close of business on the preceding June 30, including any
        amounts in the account attributable to loans made under section
        360(d) of this title before October 1, 1985, but disregarding
        the obligation to repay such loans and interest thereon. In
        determining such balance as of June 30 of any year, so much of
        the balance to the credit of the railroad unemployment
        insurance administration fund as of the close of business on
        such date as is in excess of $6,000,000 shall be deemed to be
        part of the balance to the credit of such account. There will
        be a surcharge rate for the calendar year only if that balance
        is less than the greater of $100,000,000 or of the amount that
        bears the same ratio to $100,000,000 as the system compensation
        base as of that June 30 bears to the system compensation base
        as of June 30, 1991, as computed in accordance with paragraph
        (11).
        (B) Step 2
          (i) If the balance to the credit of the account is less than
        the greater of the amounts referred to in the 2nd sentence of
        step 1 but is equal to or more than the greater of $50,000,000
        or of the amount that bears the same ratio to $50,000,000 as
        the system compensation base as of that June 30 bears to the
        system compensation base as of June 30, 1991, then the
        surcharge rate for the calendar year shall be 1.5 percent.
          (ii) If the balance to the credit of the account is less than
        the greater of the amounts referred to in the clause (i), but
        greater than or equal to zero, then the surcharge rate for the
        calendar year shall be 2.5 percent.
          (iii) If the balance to the credit of the account is less
        than zero, the surcharge rate for the calendar year shall be
        3.5 percent.
      (15) Chargeable benefits
        (A) In general
          Beginning January 1, 1990, all benefits paid to an employee
        for days of unemployment or days of sickness shall be charged
        to that employee's base year employer by adding amounts equal
        to the amounts of such benefits to the employer's cumulative
        benefit balance except that benefits paid by reason of strikes
        or work stoppages growing out of labor disputes shall not be
        added to the employer's cumulative benefit balance but instead
        shall be added to the system unallocated charge balance.
        (B) Adjustments
          A sum equal to each amount realized in recovery for
        overpayment, erroneous payment, or reimbursement of benefits
        and credited to the account pursuant to section 360(a)(v) or
        360(a)(viii) of this title shall be subtracted from the
        cumulative benefit balances of the employers of the employees
        to whom such an amount was paid as a benefit in the proportion
        to the amount by which each such employer's cumulative benefit
        balance was increased as a result of the payment of the
        benefit.
        (C) Multiple employers
          (i) In general
            All benefits paid to an employee who had more than 1 base-
          year employer shall be charged to the cumulative benefit
          balances of the employee's base year employers - 
              (I) in reverse chronological order of the employee's
            employment with each such employer in the base year if the
            employer at the time of the claim was the last base year
            employer, and the amount charged to each employer shall not
            exceed the compensation paid by that employer to the
            employee in the base year; and
              (II) in all other cases, in the same ratio as the
            compensation paid to such employee by the employer bears to
            the total of such compensation paid to such employees by
            all such employers in the base year.
          (ii) Special rule for employer with cancelled balances
            All benefits chargeable under this subparagraph to an
          employer for which the Board has cancelled balances under
          paragraph (16) shall be added to the system unallocated
          charge balance.
      (16) Defunct employer
        Whenever the Board determines, pursuant to such regulations as
      the Board may prescribe, that an employer has permanently ceased
      to pay compensation with respect to which contributions are
      payable pursuant to this subsection, the Board shall, effective
      on the date of the Board's determination, transfer the employer's
      net cumulative contribution balance as a subtraction from, and
      cumulative benefit balance as an addition to, the system
      unallocated charge balance and cancel all other accumulations of
      the employer.
      (17) Individual employer record
        (A) In general
          As of January 1, 1990, the Board shall commence maintaining
        an individual employer record with respect to each employer,
        and the records necessary to determine pooled charges, pooled
        credits and unallocated charge balances for the system.
        Whenever a new employer begins paying compensation with respect
        to which contributions are payable pursuant to this subsection,
        the Board shall establish and maintain an individual employer
        record for such employer.
        (B) Definition
          As used in this paragraph, the term "individual employer
        record" means a record of an individual employer's benefit
        ratio, reserve ratio, 1-year compensation base, 3-year
        compensation base, unallocated charge, reserve balance, net
        cumulative contribution balance, and cumulative benefit
        balance.
      (18) Joint employer records
        Pursuant to regulations prescribed by the Board, the Board may
      allow 2 or more employers, upon application, to establish and
      maintain, or to discontinue, a joint individual employer record
      for such employers as though such joint record constituted a
      single employer's individual employer record.
      (19) Mergers, consolidations, or other changes in employer
        identity
        (A) With other employers
          In the event of a merger, consolidation, unification, or
        reorganization in which an employer combines with another
        employer and the combination entails no partitioning of the
        property of the employer, the individual employer records of
        the 2 employers shall be combined into a joint individual
        employer record if the parties request such joint treatment
        pursuant to paragraph (18) or if the Board otherwise
        determines, pursuant to regulations prescribed by the Board,
        that such joint treatment is desirable.
        (B) With nonemployers
          In the event of a merger, consolidation, unification, or
        reorganization in which an employer combines with another
        entity that is not an employer, the employer's individual
        employer record shall attach to the combined entity.
        (C) Sale of assets
          In the event property of an employer is sold or transferred
        to another employer or other entity, or is partitioned among 2
        or more employers or entities, the cumulative benefit balance,
        net cumulative contribution balance, 1-year compensation base,
        and 3-year compensation base of the employer shall be prorated
        among the employers which receive the property, including any
        entities which become employers by virtue of such transfer or
        partition, in such equitable manner as the Board by regulation
        shall prescribe.
        (D) Reincorporation
          The cumulative benefit balance, net cumulative contribution
        balance, 1-year compensation base, and 3-year compensation base
        of an employer that reincorporates or otherwise alters its
        corporate identity in a transaction not involving a merger,
        consolidation, or unification shall attach to the
        reincorporated or altered entity.
        (E) Abandonment
          If an employer abandons property or discontinues service but
        continues to operate as an employer, the employer's individual
        employer record shall continue to be calculated as provided in
        this subsection without retroactive adjustment.
      (20) Maximum contribution limit
        The maximum contribution limit with respect to a calendar year
      is 12 percent, unless a 3.5 percent surcharge under paragraph
      (14) is in effect with respect to that calendar year. If such a
      surcharge is in effect the maximum contribution limit with
      respect to that calendar year is 12.5 percent.
      (21) Special rules for certain computations under paragraph
        (1)(C)
        (A) Any computation that is to be made under paragraph (1)(C)
      on the basis of a 12-quarter period ending on a given June 30
      shall be made on the basis of a period - 
          (i) beginning on the later of - 
            (I) January 1, 1990;
            (II) the first day of the first calendar quarter that
          begins after the date on which the employer first began to
          pay compensation subject to this chapter; or
            (III) July 1 of the third calendar year preceding that June
          30; and

          (ii) ending on that June 30.

        (B) The amount computed under subparagraph (A) shall be
      increased to an amount that bears the same ratio to the amount so
      computed as 12 bears to the number of calendar quarters on which
      the computation is based.
    (b) Employee representative contribution
      Each employee representative shall pay a contribution with
    respect to so much of the compensation paid to him for services
    performed as an employee representative as is not in excess of the
    monthly compensation base computed in accordance with section
    351(i) of this title, at a rate which shall be determined under
    subsection (a) of this section in the same manner and with the same
    effect as if the employee organization by which such employee
    representative is employed were an employer as defined in this
    chapter.
    (c) Board proclamation of balance
      (1) In general
        Not later than October 15, 1990, and October 15 of each year
      thereafter the Board shall proclaim - 
          (A) the balance to the credit of the account as of the
        preceding June 30 for purposes of paragraphs (12) and (14) of
        subsection (a) of this section;
          (B) the balance of any advances to the account under section
        360(d) of this title after September 30, 1985, that has not
        been repaid with interest as provided in such section as of
        September 30 of that year;
          (C) the system compensation base as of that June 30 as
        computed in accordance with paragraph (11) of that subsection;
          (D) the system unallocated charge balance as of that June 30,
        as computed in accordance with paragraph (10) of that
        subsection; and
          (E) the pooled credit ratio, the pooled charge ratio, and the
        surcharge rate, if any, as determined under paragraph (12),
        (13), or (14) of that subsection and applicable in the
        following calendar year.
      (2) Publication of notice
        As soon as is practicable after such proclamation, the Board
      shall publish notice in the Federal Register of the amounts so
      determined and proclaimed.
    (d) Notifications by Board
      (1) Not later than the last day of any calendar quarter that
    begins after March 31, 1990, the Board shall notify each employer
    and employee representative of its net cumulative contribution
    balance and cumulative benefit balance as of the end of the
    preceding calendar quarter, as computed in accordance with
    paragraphs (7) and (8) of subsection (a) of this section as of the
    last day of such preceding calendar quarter rather than as of a
    given June 30 if such last day is not a June 30.
      (2) Not later than October 15, 1990, and October 15 of each year
    thereafter, the Board shall notify each employer and employee
    representative of its benefit ratio, reserve ratio, 1-year
    compensation base, 3-year compensation base, unallocated charge,
    and reserve balance as of the preceding June 30 as computed in
    accordance with paragraphs (2), (3), (4), (5), (6), and (9) of
    subsection (a) of this section, and of the contribution rate
    applicable to the employer or employee representative in the
    following calendar year as computed under paragraphs (1)(B), (C),
    or (D) of that subsection.
    (e) Information to verify accuracy to be made available
      Notwithstanding any other provision of law, upon request by an
    employer or employee representative, the Board shall make available
    to such employer or employee representative any information
    available to the Board which may be necessary to verify the
    accuracy of a contribution rate determined by the Board to be
    applicable to such employer or employee representative, or of any
    component of that contribution rate including the accuracy of the
    employer's individual employer record, upon payment by such
    employer or employee representative to the Board of the cost
    incurred by the Board in making such information available. The
    amounts so paid to the Board shall be credited to and deposited in
    the fund.
    (f) Fractional parts of a cent
      In the payment of any contribution under this chapter, a
    fractional part of a cent shall be disregarded unless it amounts to
    one-half cent or more, in which case it shall be increased to one
    cent.
    (g) Adjustments for improper payments
      If more or less than the correct amount of the contribution
    required by this section is paid with respect to any compensation,
    then, under regulations prescribed under this chapter by the Board,
    proper adjustments with respect to the contribution shall be made,
    without interest, in connection with subsequent contribution
    payments made under this chapter by the same employer or employee
    representative.
    (h) Refunding overpayment; collecting underpayment
      If more or less than the correct amount of the contribution
    required by this section is paid with respect to any compensation
    and the overpayment or underpayment of the contribution cannot be
    adjusted under subsection (d) of this section, the amount of the
    overpayment shall be refunded from the account, or the amount of
    the underpayment shall be collected, in such manner and at such
    times (subject to the statute of limitations properly applicable
    thereto) as may be prescribed by regulations of the Board.
    (i) Collection and deposit of contributions
      The contributions required by this chapter shall be collected by
    the Board and shall be deposited by it with the Secretary of the
    Treasury of the United States, such part thereof as equals 0.65 per
    centum of the total compensation on which such contributions are
    based to be deposited to the credit of the fund and the balance to
    be deposited to the credit of the account.
    (j) Time for payment; failure to pay promptly
      The contributions required by this chapter shall be collected and
    paid quarterly or at such other times and in such manner and under
    such conditions not inconsistent with this chapter as may be
    prescribed by regulations of the Board, and shall not be deducted,
    in whole or in part, from the compensation of employees in the
    employer's employ. If a contribution required by this chapter is
    not paid when due, there shall be added to the amount payable
    (except in the case of adjustments made in accordance with the
    provisions of this chapter) interest at the rate of 1 per centum
    per month or fraction of a month from the date the contribution
    became due until paid. Any interest collected pursuant to this
    subsection shall be credited to the account.
    (k) Application of other laws; authority of Board
      All provisions of law, including penalties, applicable with
    respect to any tax imposed by the provisions of the Railroad
    Retirement Tax Act [26 U.S.C. 3201 et seq.], insofar as applicable

    TITLE 45 - RAILROADS
    CHAPTER 11 - RAILROAD UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE

-HEAD-
    Sec. 360. Railroad unemployment insurance account

-STATUTE-
    (a) Funds constituting account; availability for benefits or
      refunds
      The Secretary of the Treasury shall maintain in the unemployment
    trust fund established pursuant to section 1104 of title 42 an
    account to be known as the railroad unemployment insurance account.
    This account shall consist of (i) such part of all contributions
    collected pursuant to section 358 of this title as is in excess of
    0.65 per centum of the total compensation on which such
    contributions are based, together with all interest collected
    pursuant to section 358(g) (!1) of this title; (ii) all amounts
    transferred or paid into the account pursuant to section 363 or
    section 364 of this title; (iii) all additional amounts
    appropriated to the account in accordance with any provision of
    this chapter or with any provision of law now or hereafter adopted;
    (iv) a proportionate part of the earnings of the unemployment trust
    fund, computed in accordance with the provisions of section 1104(e)
    of title 42; (v) all amounts realized in recoveries for
    overpayments or erroneous payments of benefits; (vi) all amounts
    transferred thereto pursuant to section 361 of this title; (vii)
    all fines or penalties collected pursuant to the provisions of this
    chapter; and (viii) all amounts credited thereto pursuant to
    section 352(f) or section 362(g) of this title. Notwithstanding any
    other provision of law, all moneys credited to the account shall be
    mingled and undivided, and are permanently appropriated to the
    Board to be continuously available to the Board without further
    appropriation, for the payment of benefits and refunds under this
    chapter, and no part thereof shall lapse at any time, or be carried
    to the surplus fund or any other fund.

    (b) Payment of benefits or refunds
      All moneys in the account shall be used solely for the payment of
    the benefits and refunds provided for by this chapter. The Board
    shall, from time to time, certify to the Secretary of the Treasury
    the name and address of each person or company entitled to receive
    benefits or a refund payment under this chapter, the amount of such
    payment, and the time at which it shall be made. Prior to audit or
    settlement by the Government Accountability Office, the Secretary
    of the Treasury, through the Fiscal Service of the Treasury
    Department, shall make payments from the account directly to such
    person or company of the amount of benefits or refund so certified
    by the Board: Provided, however, That if the Board shall so
    request, the Secretary of the Treasury, through the Fiscal Service
    of the Treasury Department, shall transmit benefits payments to the
    Board for distribution by it through employment offices or in such
    other manner as the Board deems proper.
    (c) Annual report to Congress
      The Board shall include in its annual report to Congress a
    statement with respect to the status and operation of the account.
    (d) Transfer and retransfer of funds; interest
      Whenever the Board finds at any time that the balance in the
    railroad unemployment insurance account will be insufficient to pay
    the benefits and refunds which it estimates are due, or will become
    due, under this chapter, it shall request the Secretary of the
    Treasury to transfer from the Railroad Retirement Account to the
    credit of the railroad unemployment insurance account such moneys
    as the Board estimates would be necessary for the payment of such
    benefits and refunds, and the Secretary shall make such transfer.
    Whenever the Board finds that the balance in the railroad
    unemployment insurance account, without regard to the amounts
    transferred pursuant to the next preceding sentence, is sufficient
    to pay such benefits and refunds, it shall request the Secretary of
    the Treasury to retransfer from the railroad unemployment insurance
    account to the credit of the Railroad Retirement Account such
    moneys as in its judgment are not needed for the payment of such
    benefits and refunds, plus interest at a rate for each fiscal year
    equal to the average rate of interest borne by all special
    obligations held by the Railroad Retirement Account on the last day
    of the preceding fiscal year, rounded to the nearest multiple of
    one-eighth of 1 per centum, and the Secretary shall make such
    retransfer. In determining the balance in the railroad unemployment
    insurance account as of September 30 of any year pursuant to
    section 358(a) of this title, any moneys transferred from the
    Railroad Retirement Account to the credit of the railroad
    unemployment insurance account which have not been retransferred as
    of such date from the latter account to the credit of the former,
    plus the interest accrued thereon to that date, shall be
    disregarded.

    CHAPTER 11 - RAILROAD UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE

-HEAD-
    Sec. 361. Railroad unemployment insurance administration fund

-STATUTE-
    (a) Maintenance of account; amounts constituting fund
      The Secretary of the Treasury shall maintain in the unemployment
    trust fund established pursuant to section 904 of the Social
    Security Act [42 U.S.C. 1104] an account to be known as the
    railroad unemployment insurance administration fund. This
    unemployment insurance administration fund shall consist of (i)
    such part of all contributions collected pursuant to section 358 of
    this title as equals 0.65 per centum of the total compensation on
    which such contributions are based; (ii) all amounts advanced to
    the fund by the Secretary of the Treasury pursuant to this section;
    (iii) all amounts appropriated by subsection (b) of this section;
    and (iv) such additional amounts as Congress may appropriate for
    expenses necessary or incidental to administering this chapter.
    Such additional amounts are authorized to be appropriated.
    (b) Authorization of appropriations; advance of sums; repayment
      In addition to the other moneys herein provided for expenses
    necessary or incidental to administering this chapter, there is
    appropriated to the fund such amount as the Secretary of the
    Treasury and the Board shall jointly estimate to have been
    collected or to be collectible with respect to the calendar years
    1936, 1937, 1938, and 1939, from employers subject to this chapter,
    under title IX of the Social Security Act, less such amount as the
    Secretary of the Treasury and the Board shall jointly estimate will
    be appropriated or has been appropriated to States or Territories
    pursuant to the Act of Congress approved August 24, 1937 (Public,
    Numbered 353, Seventy-fifth Congress), as proceeds of taxes paid by
    employers pursuant to title IX of the Social Security Act.
      Until the amount appropriated by this subsection is credited to
    the fund, the Secretary of the Treasury is directed to advance to
    the credit of the fund such sums, but not more than $2,000,000, as
    the Board requests for the purpose of financing the costs of
    administering this chapter. Such advance shall be repaid from the
    fund at such time after the amount appropriated by this subsection
    is credited to the fund as the Board by agreement with the
    Secretary of the Treasury may determine, but not later than January
    1, 1940.
    (c) Availability for administrative expenses
      Notwithstanding any other provision of law, all moneys at any
    time credited to the fund are permanently appropriated to the Board
    to be continuously available to the Board without further
    appropriation for any expenses necessary or incidental to
    administering this chapter, including personal services in the
    District of Columbia and elsewhere; travel expenses, including
    expenses of attendance at meetings when authorized by the Board;
    actual transportation expenses and not to exceed $10 per diem to
    cover subsistence and other expenses while in attendance at and en
    route to and from the place to which he is invited, to any person
    other than an employee of the Federal Government who may, from time
    to time, be invited to the city of Washington or elsewhere for
    conference or advisory purposes in furthering the work of the
    Board; when found by the Board to be in the interest of the
    Government, not exceeding 3 per centum, in any fiscal year, of the
    amounts credited during such year to the fund, for engaging persons
    or organizations, by contract or otherwise, for any special
    technical or professional services, determined necessary by the
    Board, including but not restricted to accounting, actuarial,
    statistical, and reporting services, without regard to section 5 of
    title 41 and the provisions of other laws applicable to the
    employment and compensation of officers and employees of the United
    States; services; advertising, postage, telephone, telegraph,
    teletype, and other communication services and tolls; supplies;
    reproducing, photographing, and all other equipment, office
    appliances, and laborsaving devices, including devices for internal
    communication and conveyance; purchase and exchange, operation,
    maintenance and repair of motor-propelled passenger-carrying
    vehicles to be used only for official purposes in the District of
    Columbia and in the field; printing and binding; purchase and
    exchange of law books, books of reference, and directories;
    periodicals, newspapers and press clippings, in such amounts as the
    Board deems necessary, without regard to the provisions of section
    192 of the Revised Statutes; manuscripts and special reports;
    membership fees or dues in organizations which issue publications
    to members only, or to members at a lower price than to others,
    payment for which may be made in advance; rentals, including
    garages, in the District of Columbia or elsewhere; alterations and
    repairs; if found by the Board to be necessary to expedite the
    certification to the Board by the Director of the Office of
    Personnel Management of persons eligible to be employed by the
    Board, and to the extent that the Board finds such expedition
    necessary, meeting the expenses of the Director of the Office of
    Personnel Management in holding examinations for testing the
    fitness of applicants for admission to the classified service for
    employment by the Board pursuant to the second paragraph of section
    362(l) of this title, but not to exceed the additional expenses
    found by the Board to have been incurred by reason of the holding
    of such examinations; and miscellaneous items, including those for
    public instruction and information deemed necessary by the Board:
    Provided, That section 5 of title 41 shall not be construed to
    apply to any purchase or procurement of supplies or services by the
    Board from moneys in the fund when the aggregate amount involved
    does not exceed $300. Determinations of the Board whether the fund
    or an appropriation for the administration of the Railroad
    Retirement Act of 1974 [45 U.S.C. 231 et seq.] is properly
    chargeable with the authorized expenses, or parts thereof, incurred
    in the administration of such Act, or of this chapter, shall be
    binding and conclusive for all purposes and upon all persons,
    including the Comptroller General and any other administrative or
    accounting officer, employee, or agent of the United States and
    shall not be subject to review in any manner.
    (d) Transfer of excess to insurance account
      So much of the balance in the fund as of September 30 of each
    year as is in excess of $6,000,000 shall as of such date be
    transferred from the fund and credited to the account.

-HEAD-
    Sec. 362. Duties and powers of Board

-STATUTE-
    (a) Witnesses; subpenas, service, fees, etc.
      For the purpose of any investigation or other proceeding relative
    to the determination of any right to benefits, or relative to any
    other matter within its jurisdiction under this chapter, the Board
    shall have the power to issue subpenas requiring the attendance and
    testimony of witnesses and the production of any evidence,
    documentary or otherwise, that relates to any matter under
    investigation or in question, before the Board or any member,
    employee, or representative thereof. Any member of the Board or any
    of its employees or representatives designated by it may administer
    oaths and affirmations, examine witnesses, and receive evidence.
    Such attendance of witnesses and production of evidence may be
    required from any place in the United States or any Territory or
    possession thereof at any designated place of hearing. All subpenas
    may be served and returned by anyone authorized by the Board in the
    same manner as is now provided by law for the service and return by
    United States marshals of subpenas in suits in equity. Such service
    may also be made by registered mail or by certified mail and in
    such case the return post-office receipt shall be proof of service.
    Witnesses summoned in accordance with this subsection shall be paid
    the same fees and mileage as are paid witnesses in the district
    courts of the United States.
    (b) Enforcement of subpenas by courts; contempts; service of
      orders, writs, or processes
      In case of contumacy by, or refusal to obey a subpena lawfully
    issued to, any person, the Board may invoke the aid of the district
    court of the United States or the United States courts of any
    Territory or possession, where such person is found or resides or
    is otherwise subject to service of process, or the United States
    District Court for the District of Columbia if the investigation or
    proceeding is being carried on in the District of Columbia, or the
    United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois,
    if the investigation or proceeding is being carried on in the
    Northern District of Illinois, in requiring the attendance and
    testimony of witnesses and the production of evidence. Any such
    court shall issue an order requiring such person to appear before
    the Board or its specified employee or representative at the place
    specified in the subpena of the Board, whether within or without
    the judicial district of the court, there to produce evidence, if
    so ordered, or there to give testimony concerning the matter under
    investigation or in question; and any failure to obey such order of
    the court may be punished by said court as a contempt thereof. All
    orders, writs, and processes in any such proceeding may be served
    in the judicial district of the district court issuing such order,
    writ, or process, except that the orders, writs, and processes of
    the United States District Court for the District of Columbia or of
    the United States District Court for the Northern District of
    Illinois in such proceedings may run and be served anywhere in the
    United States.
    (c) Repealed. Pub. L. 91-452, title II, Sec. 239, Oct. 15, 1970, 84
      Stat. 930
    (d) Information as confidential
      Information obtained by the Board in connection with the
    administration of this chapter shall not be revealed or open to
    inspection nor be published in any manner revealing an employee's
    identity: Provided, however, That (i) the Board may arrange for the
    exchange of any information with governmental agencies engaged in
    functions related to the administration of this chapter; (ii) the
    Board may disclose such information in cases in which the Board
    finds that such disclosure is clearly in furtherance of the
    interest of the employee or his estate; (iii) any claimant of
    benefits under this chapter shall, upon his request, be supplied
    with information from the Board's records pertaining to his claim;
    and (iv) the Board shall disclose to any base-year employer of a
    claimant for benefits any information, including information as to
    the claimant's identity, that is necessary or appropriate to notify
    such employer of the claim for benefits or to full and fair
    participation by such employer in an appeal, hearing, or other
    proceeding relative to the claim pursuant to section 355 of this
    title. Subject to the provisions of this section, the Board may
    furnish such information to any person or organization upon payment
    by such person or organization to the Board of the cost incurred by
    the Board by reason thereof; and the amounts so paid to the Board
    shall be credited to the railroad unemployment insurance
    administration fund established pursuant to section 361(a) of this
    title;
    (e) Certification of claims; authorization of employee to make
      payments; bond
      The Board shall provide for the certification of claims for
    benefits and refunds and may arrange total or partial settlements
    at such times and in such manner as may appear to the Board to be
    expedient. The Board shall designate and authorize one or more of
    its employees to sign vouchers for the payment of benefits and
    refunds under this chapter. Each such employee shall give bond, in
    form and amount fixed by the Board, conditioned upon the faithful
    performance of his duties. The premiums due on such bonds shall be
    paid from the fund and deemed to be a part of the expenses of
    administering this chapter.
    (f) Cooperation with other agencies administering unemployment or
      sickness compensation laws; agreements
      The Board may cooperate with or enter into agreement with the
    appropriate agencies charged with the administration of State,
    Territorial, Federal, or foreign unemployment-compensation or
    sickness laws or employment offices, with respect to
    investigations, the exchange of information and services, the
    establishment, maintenance, and use of free employment service
    facilities, and such other matters as the Board deems expedient in
    connection with the administration of this chapter, and may
    compensate any such agency for services or facilities supplied to
    the Board in connection with the administration of this chapter.
    The Board may enter also into agreements with any such agency,
    pursuant to which any unemployment or sickness benefits provided
    for by this chapter or any other unemployment-compensation or
    sickness law, may be paid through a single agency to persons who
    have, during the period on the basis of which eligibility for and
    duration of benefits is determined under the law administered by
    such agency or under this chapter, or both, performed services
    covered by one or more of such laws, or performed services which
    constitute employment as defined in this chapter: Provided, That
    the Board finds that any such agreement is fair and reasonable as
    to all affected interests.
    (g) Benefits also subject to a State law; mutual reimbursement
      In determining whether an employee has qualified for benefits in
    accordance with section 353 of this title, and in determining the
    amount of benefits to be paid to such employee in accordance with
    section 352(a) and (c) of this title, the Board is authorized to
    consider as employment (and compensation therefor) services for
    hire other than employment (and remuneration therefor) if such
    services for hire are subject to an unemployment or sickness
    compensation law of any State, provided that such State has agreed
    to reimburse the United States such portion of the benefits to be
    paid upon such basis to such employee as the Board deems equitable.
    Any amounts collected pursuant to this paragraph shall be credited
    to the account.
      If a State, in determining whether an employee is eligible for
    unemployment or sickness benefits under an unemployment or sickness
    compensation law of such State, and in determining the amount of
    unemployment or sickness benefits to be paid to such employee
    pursuant to such unemployment or sickness compensation law,
    considers as services for hire (and remuneration therefor) included
    within the provisions of such unemployment or sickness compensation
    law, employment (and compensation therefor), the Board is
    authorized to reimburse such State such portion of such
    unemployment or sickness benefits as the Board deems equitable;
    such reimbursements shall be paid from the account, and are
    included within the meaning of the word "benefits" as used in this
    chapter.
    (h) Assistance from employers and labor organizations; compensation
      The Board may enter into agreements or arrangements with
    employers, organizations of employers, and railway-labor
    organizations which are duly organized in accordance with the
    provisions of the Railway Labor Act [45 U.S.C. 151 et seq.], for
    securing the performance of services or the use of facilities in
    connection with the administration of this chapter, and may
    compensate any such employer or organization therefor upon such
    reasonable basis as the Board shall prescribe, but not to exceed
    the additional expense incurred by such employer or organization by
    reason of the performance of such services or making available the
    use of such facilities pursuant to such agreements or arrangements.
    Such employers and organizations, and persons employed by either of
    them, shall not be subject to section 209 of title 18.
    (i) Free employment offices; registration of unemployed; statements
      of sickness; reemployment
      The Board may establish, maintain, and operate free employment
    offices, and may designate as free employment offices facilities
    maintained by (i) a railway labor organization which is duly
    authorized and designated to represent employees in accordance with
    the Railway Labor Act [45 U.S.C. 151 et seq.], or (ii) any other
    labor organization which has been or may be organized in accordance
    with the provisions of the Railway Labor Act, or (iii) one or more
    employers, or (iv) an organization of employers, or (v) a group of
    such employers and labor organizations, or (vi) a State,
    Territorial, foreign, or the Federal Government. The Board may also
    enter into agreements or arrangements with one or more employers or
    railway labor organizations organized in accordance with the
    provisions of the Railway Labor Act, pursuant to which notice of
    the availability of work and the rights of employees with respect
    to such work under agreements between such employers and railway
    labor organizations may be filed with employment offices and
    pursuant to which employees registered with employment offices may
    be referred to such work.
      The Board shall prescribe a procedure for registration of
    unemployed employees at employment offices. Such procedure for
    registration shall be prescribed with a view to such registration
    affording substantial evidence of the days of unemployment of the
    employees who register. The Board may, when such registration is
    made personally by an employee, accept such registration as initial
    proof of unemployment sufficient to certify for payment a claim for
    benefits.
      The Board shall provide a form or forms for statements of
    sickness and a procedure for the execution and filing thereof. Such
    forms and procedure shall be designated with a view to having such
    statements provide substantial evidence of the days of sickness of
    the employee. Such statements may be executed by any doctor
    (authorized to practice in the State or foreign jurisdiction in
    which he practices his profession) or any officer or supervisory
    employee of a hospital, clinic, group health association, or other
    similar organization, who is qualified under such regulations as
    the Board may prescribe to execute such statements. The Board shall
    issue regulations for the qualification of such persons to execute
    such statements. When so executed by any such person, or, in the
    discretion of the Board, by others designated by the Board
    individually or by groups, they may be accepted as initial proof of
    days of sickness sufficient to certify for payment a claim for
    benefits.
      The regulations of the Board concerning registration at
    employment offices by unemployed persons may provide for group
    registration and reporting, through employers, and need not be
    uniform with respect to different classes of employees.
      The operation of any employment facility operated by the Board
    shall be directed primarily toward the reemployment of employees
    who have theretofore been substantially employed by employers.
    (j) Advisory councils; members' remuneration
      The Board may appoint national or local advisory councils
    composed of equal numbers of representatives of employers,
    representatives of employees, and persons representing the general
    public, for the purpose of discussing problems in connection with
    the administration of this chapter and aiding the Board in
    formulating policies. The members of such councils shall serve
    without remuneration, but shall be reimbursed for any necessary
    traveling and subsistence expenses or on a per diem basis in lieu
    of subsistence expenses.
    (k) Reduction of unemployment; training and reemployment of
      unemployed employees, etc.
      The Board, with the advice and aid of any advisory council
    appointed by it, shall take appropriate steps to reduce and prevent
    unemployment and loss of earnings; to encourage and assist in the
    adoption of practical methods of vocational training, retraining,
    and vocational guidance; to promote the reemployment of unemployed
    employees; and to these ends to carry on and publish the results of
    investigations and research studies.
    (l) Necessary and incidental powers; employees of Board,
      employment, remuneration, civil-service laws, registration of
      unemployed, and detail
      In addition to the powers and duties expressly provided, the
    Board shall have and exercise all the powers and duties necessary
    to administer or incidental to administering this chapter, and in
    connection therewith shall have such of the powers, duties, and
    remedies provided in subdivisions (5), (6), and (9) of section 7(b)
    of the Railroad Retirement Act of 1974 [45 U.S.C. 231f(b)] with
    respect to the administration of the Railroad Retirement Act of
    1974 [45 U.S.C. 231 et seq.], as are not inconsistent with the
    express provisions of this chapter. A person in the employ of the
    Board under section 205 of the Act of Congress approved June 24,
    1937 (50 Stat. 307), shall acquire a competitive classified civil-
    service status if, after recommendation by the Board to the
    Director of the Office of Personnel Management, he shall pass such
    noncompetitive tests of fitness as the Director of the Office of
    Personnel Management may prescribe. A person in the employ of the
    Board on June 30, 1939, and on June 30, 1940, and who has had
    experience in railroad service, shall acquire a competitive
    classified civil-service status if, after recommendation by the
    Board to the Director of the Office of Personnel Management, he
    shall pass such noncompetitive tests of fitness for the position
    for which the Board recommends him as the Director of the Office of
    Personnel Management may prescribe.
      The Board may employ such persons and provide for their
    remuneration and expenses, as may be necessary for the proper
    administration of this chapter. Such persons shall be employed and
    their remuneration prescribed in accordance with the civil-service
    laws and chapter 51 and subchapter III of chapter 53 of title 5:
    Provided, That all positions to which such persons are appointed,
    except one administrative assistant to each member of the Board,
    shall be in and under the competitive civil service and shall not
    be removed or excepted therefrom: Provided, That in the employment
    of such persons the Board shall give preference, as between
    applicants attaining the same grades, to persons who have had
    experience in railroad service, and notwithstanding any other
    provisions of law, rules, or regulations, no other preference shall
    be given or recognized: And provided further, That certification by
    the Director of the Office of Personnel Management of persons for
    appointment to any positions at minimum salaries of $4,600 per
    annum, or less, shall, if the Board so requests, be upon the basis
    of competitive examinations, written, oral, or both, as the Board
    may request: And provided further, That, for the purpose of
    registering unemployed employees who reside in areas in which no
    employer facilities are located, or in which no employer will make
    facilities available for the registration of such employees, the
    Board may, without regard to civil-service laws and chapter 51 and
    subchapter III of chapter 53 of title 5, appoint persons to accept,
    in such areas, registration of such employees and perform services
    incidental thereto and may compensate such persons on a piece-rate
    basis to be determined by the Board. Notwithstanding any other
    provision of law, the Board may detail employees from stations
    outside the District of Columbia to other stations outside the
    District of Columbia or to service in the District of Columbia, and
    may detail employees in the District of Columbia to service outside
    the District of Columbia: Provided, That all details hereunder
    shall be made by specific order and in no case for a period of time
    exceeding one hundred and twenty days. Details so made may, on
    expiration, be renewed from time to time by order of the Board, in
    each particular case, for periods not exceeding one hundred and
    twenty days.
    (m) Delegation of powers
      The Board is authorized to delegate to any member, officer, or
    employee of the Board any of the powers conferred upon the Board by
    this chapter, excluding only the power to prescribe rules and
    regulations.
    (n) Sickness benefits; examinations; information and reports;
      contracts and expenses for examinations
      Any employee claiming, entitled to, or receiving sickness
    benefits under this chapter may be required to take such
    examination, physical, medical, mental, or otherwise, in such
    manner and at such times and by such qualified individuals,
    including medical officers or employees of the United States or a
    State, as the Board may prescribe. The place or places of
    examination shall be reasonably convenient for the employee. No
    sickness benefits shall be payable under this chapter with respect
    to any period during which the employee unreasonably refuses to
    take or willfully obstructs an examination as prescribed by the
    Board.
      Any doctor who renders any attendance, treatment, attention, or
    care, or performs any examination with respect to a sickness of an
    employee, upon which a claim or right to benefits under this
    chapter is based, shall furnish the Board, in such manner and form
    and at such times as the Board by regulations may prescribe,
    information and reports relative thereto and to the condition of
    the employee. An application for sickness benefits under this
    chapter shall contain a waiver of any doctor-patient privilege that
    the employee may have with respect to any sickness period upon
    which such application is based: Provided, That such information
    shall not be disclosed by the Board except in a proceeding relating
    to any claim for benefits by the employee under this chapter.
      The Board may enter into agreements or arrangements with doctors,
    hospitals, clinics, or other persons for securing the examination,
    physical, medical, mental, or otherwise, of employees claiming,
    entitled to, or receiving sickness benefits under this chapter and
    the performance of services or the use of facilities in connection
    with the execution of statements of sickness. The Board may
    compensate any such doctors, hospitals, clinics, or other persons
    upon such reasonable basis as the Board shall prescribe. Such
    doctors, hospitals, clinics, or other persons and persons employed
    by any of them shall not be subject to section 209 of title 18. In
    the event that the Board pays for the physical or mental
    examination of an employee or for the execution of a statement of
    sickness and such employee's claim for benefits is based upon such
    examination or statement, the Board shall deduct from any sickness
    benefits payable to the employee pursuant to such claim such amount
    as, in the judgment of the Board, is a fair and reasonable charge
    for such examination or execution of such statement.
    (o) Liability of third party for sickness; reimbursement of Board
      Benefits payable to an employee with respect to days of sickness
    shall be payable regardless of the liability of any person to pay
    damages for such infirmity. The Board shall be entitled to
    reimbursement from any sum or damages paid or payable to such
    employee or other person through suit, compromise, settlement,
    judgment, or otherwise on account of any liability (other than a
    liability under a health, sickness, accident, or similar insurance
    policy) based upon such infirmity, to the extent that it will have
    paid or will pay benefits for days of sickness resulting from such
    infirmity. Upon notice to the person against whom such right or
    claim exists or is asserted, the Board shall have a lien upon such
    right or claim, any judgment obtained thereunder, and any sum or
    damages paid under such right or claim, to the extent of the amount
    to which the Board is entitled by way of reimbursement.
    (p) Disqualification to execute statements of sickness or receive
      fees
      The Board may, after hearing, disqualify any person from
    executing statements of sickness who, the Board finds, (i) will
    have solicited, or will have employed another to solicit, for
    himself or for another the execution of any such statement, or (ii)
    will have made false or misleading statements to the Board, to any
    employer, or to any employee, in connection with the awarding of
    any benefits under this chapter, or (iii) will have failed to
    submit medical reports and records required by the Board under this
    chapter, or will have failed to submit any other reports, records,
    or information required by the Board in connection with the
    administration of this chapter or any other Act heretofore or
    hereafter administered by the Board, or (iv) will have engaged in
    any malpractice or other professional misconduct. No fees or
    charges of any kind shall accrue to any such person from the Board
    after his disqualification.
    (q) Investigations and research with respect to accidents and
      disabilities
      The Board shall engage in and conduct research projects,
    investigations, and studies with respect to the cause, care, and
    prevention of, and benefits for, accidents and disabilities and
    other subjects deemed by the Board to be related thereto, and shall
    recommend legislation deemed advisable in the light of such
    research projects, investigations, and studies.
    (r) Duty of Board to make certain computations
      (1) Compensation base
        On or before December 1, 1988, and on or before December 1 of
      each year thereafter, the Board shall compute - 
          (A) in accordance with section 351(i) of this title, the
        monthly compensation base which shall be applicable with
        respect to months in the next succeeding calendar year; and

        section 352(c) of this title, section 353 of this title, and
        section 354(a-2)(i)(A) of this title that are related to
        changes in the monthly compensation base.
      (2) Maximum daily benefit rate
        On or before June 1, 1989, and on or before June 1 of each year
      thereafter, the Board shall compute in accordance with section
      352(a)(3) of this title the maximum daily benefit rate which
      shall be applicable with respect to days of unemployment and days
      of sickness in registration periods beginning after June 30 of
      that year.
      (3) Notice in Federal Register and to employers
        Not later than 10 days after each computation made under this
      subsection, the Board shall publish notice in the Federal
      Register and shall notify each employer and employee
      representative of the amount so computed.

    TITLE 45 - RAILROADS
    CHAPTER 11 - RAILROAD UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE

-HEAD-
    Sec. 363. Exclusiveness of provisions; transfers from State
      unemployment compensation accounts to railroad unemployment
      insurance account

-STATUTE-
    (a) Omitted
    (b) Effect on State unemployment compensation laws
      By enactment of this chapter the Congress makes exclusive
    provision for the payment of unemployment benefits for unemployment
    occurring after June 30, 1939, and for the payment of sickness
    benefits for sickness periods after June 30, 1947, based upon
    employment (as defined in this chapter). No employee shall have or
    assert any right to unemployment benefits under an unemployment
    compensation law of any State with respect to unemployment
    occurring after June 30, 1939, or to sickness benefits under a
    sickness law of any State with respect to sickness periods
    occurring after June 30, 1947, based upon employment (as defined in
    this chapter). The Congress finds and declares that by virtue of
    the enactment of this chapter, the application of State
    unemployment compensation laws after June 30, 1939 or of State
    sickness laws after June 30, 1947, to such employment, except
    pursuant to section 362(g) of this title, would constitute an undue
    burden upon, and an undue interference with the effective
    regulation of, interstate commerce. In furtherance of such
    determination, after June 30, 1939, the term "person" as used in
    section 1106 of title 42 shall not be construed to include any
    employer (as defined in this chapter) or any person in its employ:
    Provided, That no provision of this chapter shall be construed to
    affect the payment of unemployment benefits with respect to any
    period prior to July 1, 1939, under an unemployment compensation
    law of any State based upon employment performed prior to July 1,
    1939, and prior to such date employment as defined in this chapter
    shall not constitute "Service with respect to which unemployment
    compensation is payable under an [or "service under any"]
    unemployment compensation system [or "plan"] established by an Act
    of Congress" [or "a law of the United States"] or "employment in
    interstate commerce, of an individual who is covered by an
    unemployment compensation system established directly by an Act of
    Congress," or any term of similar import, used in any unemployment
    compensation law of any State.
    (c) Determination of "preliminary amount" for States
      The Social Security Board is directed to determine for each
    State, after agreement with the Railroad Retirement Board, and
    after consultation with such State; the total (hereinafter referred
    to as the "preliminary amount") of (i) the amount remaining as the
    balances of reserve accounts of employers as of June 30, 1939, if
    the unemployment compensation law of such State provides for a type
    of fund known as "Reserve Accounts," plus (ii) if the unemployment
    compensation law of such State provides for a type of fund known as
    "Pooled Fund" or "Pooled Account," that proportion of the balance
    of such fund or account of such State as of June 30, 1939, as the
    amount of taxes or contributions collected from employers and their
    employees prior to July 1, 1939, pursuant to its unemployment
    compensation law and credited to such fund or account bears to all
    such taxes or contributions theretofore collected from all persons
    subject to its unemployment compensation law and credited to such
    fund or account; and the additional amounts (hereinafter referred
    to as the "liquidating amount") of taxes or contributions collected
    from employers and their employees from July 1, 1939 to December
    31, 1939, pursuant to its unemployment compensation law.
    (d) Withholding amounts from certification to States; transfers to
      railroad unemployment compensation account
      The Social Security Board shall withhold from certification to
    the Secretary of the Treasury for payment the amounts determined by
    it pursuant to section 502(a) of title 42 to be necessary for the
    proper administration of each State's unemployment-compensation
    law, until an amount equal to its "preliminary amount" plus
    interest from July 1, 1939, at 2 1/2  per centum per annum on such
    portion thereof as has not been used as the measure for withholding
    certification for payment, has been so withheld from certification
    pursuant to this paragraph: Provided, however, That if a State
    shall, prior to whichever is the later of (i) thirty days after the
    close of the first regular session of its legislature which begins
    after the approval of this chapter, and (ii) July 1, 1939,
    authorize and direct the Secretary of the Treasury to transfer from
    its account in the unemployment trust fund to the railroad
    unemployment insurance account in the unemployment trust fund an
    amount equal to its "preliminary amount", no amount shall be
    withheld from certification for payment to such State pursuant to
    this paragraph.
      The Social Security Board shall withhold from certification to
    the Secretary of the Treasury for payment the amounts determined by
    it pursuant to section 502(a) of title 42 to be necessary for the
    proper administration of each State's unemployment compensation
    law, until an amount equal to its "liquidating amount" plus
    interest from January 1, 1940, at 2 1/2  per centum per annum on
    such portion thereof as has not been used as the measure for
    withholding certification for payment has been so withheld from
    certification pursuant to this paragraph: Provided, however, That
    if a State shall, prior to whichever is the later of (i) thirty
    days after the close of the first regular session of its
    legislature which begins after the approval of this chapter, and
    (ii) January 1, 1940, authorize and direct the Secretary of the
    Treasury to transfer from its account in the unemployment trust
    fund to the railroad unemployment insurance account in the
    unemployment trust fund an amount equal to its "liquidating
    amount", no amount shall be withheld from certification for payment
    to such State pursuant to this paragraph.
      The withholdings from certification directed in each of the
    foregoing paragraphs of this subsection shall begin with respect to
    each State when the Social Security Board finds that such State is
    unable to avail itself of the condition set forth in the proviso
    contained in such paragraph: Provided, however, That if the Social
    Security Board finds with respect to any State that such State (1)
    is unable to avail itself of such conditions solely by reason of
    prohibitions contained in the constitution of such State, as
    determined by a decision of the highest court of such State
    declaring invalid in whole or in part the action of the legislature
    of the State purporting to provide for transfers from the State's
    account in the Unemployment Trust Fund to the railroad unemployment
    insurance account, and (2) for similar reasons is unable to use
    amounts withdrawn from its account in the Unemployment Trust Fund
    for the payment of expenses incurred in the administration of its
    State unemployment compensation law, the Social Security Board
    shall not begin to withhold from certification to the Secretary of
    the Treasury for payment to such State the amounts determined by it
    pursuant to section 502 of title 42 and to certify to the Secretary
    of the Treasury for payment into the railroad unemployment
    insurance account the amount so withheld from such State until July
    1, 1944, or until a date one hundred and eighty days after the
    adjournment of the first session of the legislature of such State
    beginning after July 1, 1942, whichever date is the earlier, and
    then only if the Social Security Board finds that such State had
    not prior thereto effectively authorized and directed the Secretary
    of the Treasury to transfer from such State's account in the
    Unemployment Trust Fund to the railroad unemployment insurance
    account amounts equal to such State's "preliminary amount" and
    "liquidating amount" less such parts thereof, if any, as the State
    may have, within the periods set forth in the provisos contained in
    the first two paragraphs of this subsection, effectively authorized
    and directed the Secretary of the Treasury so to transfer, plus
    interest on such difference, if any, with respect to each amount,
    at 2 1/2  per centum per annum from the date the State's
    "preliminary amount" or "liquidating amount", as the case may be,
    is determined by the Social Security Board; and with respect to any
    such State the amount withheld shall equal the State's "preliminary
    amount" and "liquidating amount" less such parts thereof, if any,
    as the State may have, within the periods set forth in the provisos
    contained in the first two paragraphs of this subsection
    effectively authorized and directed the Secretary of the Treasury
    to transfer, plus interest from July 1, 1939, at 2 1/2  per centum
    per annum on so much of the "preliminary amount" and "liquidating
    amount", as the case may be, as has not been so transferred or has
    not been used as the measure for withholding. An enactment of any
    State legislature providing for the transfer (from the State's
    account in the Unemployment Trust Fund to the railroad unemployment
    insurance account) of all interest earned upon contributions which
    are collected with respect to employment occurring after such
    enactment by such State pursuant to its unemployment compensation
    law and credited to its account in the Unemployment Trust Fund
    (until the total of such transfers equals the amounts which
    otherwise would be required to be withheld from certification under
    this subsection), shall be deemed an effective authorization and
    direction to the Secretary of the Treasury as required by this
    subsection; and for purposes of computing the interest to be so
    transferred, amounts withdrawn by such State from its account in
    the Unemployment Trust Fund after the date of such State enactment
    shall be considered to be first charged against the amounts
    credited to such State's account prior to the date of such State
    enactment: Provided, however, That if at any time after such
    enactment the provision for transfer therein contained for any
    reason fails to be operative to effect the transfers of interest as
    therein prescribed, and such State has not otherwise made an
    effective authorization and direction to the Secretary of the
    Treasury as required by this subsection, the Social Security Board
    shall immediately after such failure or, on the date otherwise
    provided in this subsection for the beginning of withholdings from
    certification, whichever is later, begin to make the withholdings
    from certification provided for in this subsection in the same
    manner and to the same extent as if such enactment by such State
    had not been enacted, except that the amounts of the certifications
    withheld shall be reduced by the total amount, if any, which has
    been transferred from interest pursuant to such enactment.
    (e) Transfers and withdrawals, effect upon social security
      provisions
      The transfers described in the provisos contained in the several
    paragraphs of subsection (d) of this section shall not be deemed to
    constitute a breach of the conditions set forth in sections
    503(a)(5) and 1103(a)(4) of title 42; nor shall the withdrawal by a
    State from its account in the unemployment trust fund of amounts,
    but not to exceed the total amount the Social Security Board shall
    have withheld from certification with respect to such State
    pursuant to subsection (d) of this section, be deemed to constitute
    a breach of the conditions set forth in sections 503(a)(5) and
    1103(a)(4) of title 42, provided the moneys so withdrawn are
    expended solely for expenses which the Social Security Board
    determines to be necessary for the proper administration of such
    State's unemployment compensation law.
    (f) Payments to railroad unemployment insurance account; transfers
      from unemployment trust fund of States
      The Social Security Board is authorized and directed to certify
    to the Secretary of the Treasury for payment, and the Secretary
    shall pay, into the railroad unemployment insurance account, such
    amounts as the Social Security Board withholds from certification
    pursuant to subsection (d) of this section and the appropriations
    authorized in section 501 of title 42 shall be available for
    payments authorized by this subsection. The Secretary shall
    transfer from the account of a State in the unemployment trust fund
    to the railroad unemployment insurance account in the unemployment
    trust fund such amounts as the State authorizes and directs him so
    to transfer pursuant to subsection (d) of this section.

      Section 906 of act Aug. 10, 1939, provided as follows: "If the
    Social Security Board finds with respect to any State that the
    first regular session of such State's legislature which began after
    June 25, 1938, and adjourned prior to thirty days after the
    enactment of this act [Aug. 10, 1939] (1) had not made provision to

    Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act [this section], until after the
    thirtieth day after the close of such State's first regular or

    such legislative session, authorized and directed the Secretary of
    the Treasury to transfer from such State's account in the
    Unemployment Trust Fund to the railroad unemployment insurance

    unemployment fund to the Unemployment Trust Fund, an aggregate
    amount equal thereto shall be paid from the Unemployment Trust

    payment shall be made to his estate; and the payment so made in the
    case of any employee shall be in proportion to the contributions
    paid by such employee into the State fund: Provided, That payment

      payment of amounts based on contributions collected from
      employees.
        (2) The term "Unemployment Trust Fund" means the fund
      established by section 1104 of title 42.

    benefits under the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act, shall be
    paid unemployment benefits in accordance otherwise with the
    provisions of such Act for days of unemployment, not exceeding
    sixty-five, and not exceeding in the aggregate, an amount equal to
    50 per centum of the total amount of unemployment benefits which
    were payable to him in the benefit year in which he last exhausted
    his rights before making his first claim under this chapter, which
    occur in registration periods, as defined in the Railroad
    Unemployment Insurance Act, beginning on or after the fifteenth day
    after the date of enactment of the Temporary Extended Unemployment
    Compensation Act of 1961 [March 24, 1961], and before April 1,
    1962, and which would not be days with respect to which he would be
    held entitled otherwise to receive unemployment benefits under the
    Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act: Provided, That an employee
    entitled under this section to benefits for a day before April 1,
    1962, may receive such benefits for days in registration periods
    which begin before July 1, 1962: Provided further, That payment of
    benefits otherwise provided for in this chapter shall not be made
    with respect to any individual for any day of unemployment to the
    extent that such payment, when added to the sum of the benefits
    under the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act and under this
    chapter paid such individual with respect to prior days in the
    benefit year, would exceed one hundred and ninety-five times such
    individual's daily benefit rate for such benefit year. An employee
    who has filed, and established, a first claim for benefits under
    the provisions of the Temporary Extended Unemployment Compensation
    Act of 1961, may not thereafter establish a claim under this
    section, and an employee who has registered for, and established, a
    claim under this section may not thereafter establish a claim under
    the provisions of the Temporary Extended Unemployment Compensation
    Act of 1961. Except to the extent inconsistent with this section,

    TITLE 45 - RAILROADS
    CHAPTER 15 - EMERGENCY RAIL SERVICES

-HEAD-
    Sec. 662. Guarantee of certificates

-STATUTE-
    (a) Authority of Secretary; prerequisites; procedures; waiver
      The trustees of any railroad undergoing reorganization under
    section 77 of the Bankruptcy Act, as amended, upon approval of the
    court, may apply to the Secretary for the guarantee of
    certificates. The Secretary, after consultation with the Board, is
    authorized to guarantee such certificates upon findings in writing
    that - 
        (1) cessation of essential transportation services by the
      railroad would endanger the public welfare;
        (2) cessation of such services is imminent;
        (3) there is no other practicable means of obtaining funds to
      meet payroll and other expenses necessary to provide such
      services than the issuance of such certificates;
        (4) such certificates cannot be sold without a guarantee;
        (5) the railroad can reasonably be expected to become self-
      sustaining; and
        (6) the probable value of the assets of the railroad in the
      event of liquidation provides reasonable protection to the United
      States.

    The Secretary shall publish notice of his intention to make such
    finding in the Federal Register not less than fifteen days prior to
    such finding, give interested persons, including agencies of the
    Federal Government, an opportunity to submit written data, views,
    or arguments (with or without opportunity for oral presentation),
    and give consideration to the relevant matter presented. The
    Secretary for good cause shown and upon a finding that
    extraordinary circumstances warrant doing so may waive the
    requirements of the preceding sentence. Notwithstanding any other
    provision of this section, the Secretary, in guaranteeing
    certificates under this section, is authorized to waive the
    findings required by paragraphs (1), (5), and (6) of this
    subsection.
    (b) Conditions to guarantee
      As a condition to a guarantee, the Secretary, after consultation
    with the Board, shall require that:
        (1) the proceeds of the sale of certificates guaranteed under
      this chapter, will be used solely for meeting payroll and other
      expenses which, if not met, would preclude continued provision of
      essential transportation services by the railroad;
        (2) other revenues of the railroad will be used, to the fullest
      extent possible, for such expenses;
        (3) proceeds from the sale of assets will be devoted to the
      fullest extent possible to the provision of essential
      transportation services by the railroad; and
        (4) in the event of actual or threatened cessation of essential
      transportation services by the railroad, the Secretary shall have
      the option to procure by purchase or lease trackage rights over
      the lines of the railroad and such equipment as may be necessary
      to provide such services by the Secretary or his assignee, and,
      in the event of a default in the payment of principal or interest
      as provided by the certificates, the money paid or expenses
      incurred by the United States as a result thereof shall be deemed
      to have been applied to the purchase or lease price. The terms of
      purchase or lease shall be subject to the approval of the
      reorganization court and the operation over the lines shall be
      subject to the approval of the Board pursuant to subchapter II of
      chapter 113 of title 49, but in no event shall the rendition of
      services by the Secretary or his assignee await the outcome of
      proceedings before the reorganization court or the Board.
    (c) Certificate as administrative expense; priority of certificate
      The Secretary shall not guarantee any certificate under this
    section unless such certificate is treated as an expense of
    administration and receives the highest lien on the railroad's
    property and priority in payment under the Bankruptcy Act, except
    that this subsection shall not apply to certificates guaranteed for
    a railroad that is actively engaged in restructuring, as defined by
    the Secretary. For purposes of this subsection, the term
    "restructuring" includes an employee ownership plan or an employee-
    shipper ownership plan.
    (d) Interest rate; date of maturity; other terms and conditions
      A certificate under this chapter shall bear interest at such per
    annum rate as the Secretary deems reasonable, taking into account
    the range of interest rates prevailing in the private market for
    similar loans and the risks assumed by the Federal Government; nor
    may its maturity date, including all extensions and renewals
    thereof, be later than fifteen years from the date of original
    issuance. The Secretary may prescribe such other terms and
    conditions as he deems appropriate. In each case, the Secretary
    shall consider the feasibility of requiring the railroad to dispose
    of nonrailroad assets as a condition to a guarantee.
    (e) Maximum aggregate principal amount outstanding
      At any one time the outstanding aggregate principal amount of all
    certificates guaranteed under this chapter shall not exceed
    $200,000,000.
    (f) Rules and regulations
      The Secretary shall issue such rules and regulations as are
    appropriate to carry out the authority granted by this chapter.

-STATUTE-
    (a) Forms and denominations; maturity dates; terms and conditions;
      interest rate; purchase and sale of obligations by Secretary of
      the Treasury; authorization of appropriations
      To enable the Secretary to carry out his rights and
    responsibilities under section 662 of this title, he is authorized
    to issue to the Secretary of the Treasury notes or other
    obligations in such forms and denominations, bearing such
    maturities, and subject to such terms and conditions, as may be
    prescribed by the Secretary with the approval of the Secretary of
    the Treasury. Such notes or other obligations shall bear interest
    at a rate determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, taking into
    consideration the current average market yield on outstanding
    marketable obligations of the United States of comparable
    maturities during the month preceding the issuance of the notes or
    other obligations. The Secretary of the Treasury shall purchase any
    notes and other obligations issued hereunder and for that purpose
    he is authorized to use as a public debt transaction the proceeds
    from the sale of any securities issued under chapter 31 of title
    31, and the purposes for which securities may be issued under that
    chapter are extended to include any purchase of such notes and
    obligations. The Secretary of the Treasury may at any time sell any
    of the notes or other obligations acquired by him under this
    subsection. All redemptions, purchases, and sales by the Secretary
    of the Treasury of such notes or other obligations shall be treated
    as public debt transactions of the United States. There are
    authorized to be appropriated to the Secretary such sums as may be
    necessary to pay the principal and interest on the notes or
    obligations issued by him to the Secretary of the Treasury.
    (b) Revocation of guarantee; legal effect of guarantee; validity
      and incontestability of guaranteed certificate
      Any guarantee made by the Secretary under this chapter shall not
    be terminated, canceled, or otherwise revoked, except as provided
    by the terms and conditions prescribed by the Secretary under
    section 662(d) of this title; shall be conclusive evidence that
    such guarantee complies fully with the provisions of this chapter,
    and of the approval and legality of the principal amount, interest
    rate, and all other terms of the certificates and the guarantee;
    and shall be valid and incontestable in the hands of a holder of a
    guaranteed certificate except for fraud or material
    misrepresentation on the part of such holder.
    (c) Enforcement by Attorney General of rights accruing to United
      States because of guarantee
      The Attorney General shall take such action as may be appropriate
    to enforce any right accruing to the United States by reason of its
    having paid money or incurred expenses as a result of making such
    guarantees.

    Sec. 701. Congressional declaration of policy

-STATUTE-
    (a) Findings
      The Congress finds and declares that - 
        (1) Essential rail service in the midwest and northeast region
      of the United States is provided by railroads which are today
      insolvent and attempting to undergo reorganization under the
      Bankruptcy Act.
        (2) This essential rail service is threatened with cessation or
      significant curtailment because of the inability of the trustees
      of such railroads to formulate acceptable plans for
      reorganization. This rail service is operated over rail
      properties which were acquired for a public use, but which have
      been permitted to deteriorate and now require extensive
      rehabilitation and modernization.
        (3) The public convenience and necessity require adequate and
      efficient rail service in this region and throughout the Nation
      to meet the needs of commerce, the national defense, the
      environment, and the service requirements of passengers, United
      States mail, shippers, States and their political subdivisions,
      and consumers.
        (4) Continuation and improvement of essential rail service in
      this region is also necessary to preserve and maintain adequate
      national rail services and an efficient national rail
      transportation system.
        (5) Rail service and rail transportation offer economic and
      environmental advantages with respect to land use, air pollution,
      noise levels, energy efficiency and conservation, resource
      allocation, safety, and cost per ton-mile of movement to such
      extent that the preservation and maintenance of adequate and
      efficient rail service is in the national interest.
        (6) These needs cannot be met without substantial action by the
      Federal Government.
    (b) Purposes
      It is therefore declared to be the purpose of Congress in this
    chapter to provide for - 
        (1) the identification of a rail service system in the midwest
      and northeast region which is adequate to meet the needs and
      service requirements of this region and of the national rail
      transportation system;
        (2) the reorganization of railroads in this region into an
      economically viable system capable of providing adequate and
      efficient rail service to the region;

    SUBCHAPTER II - UNITED STATES RAILWAY ASSOCIATION

-HEAD-
    Sec. 716. Final system plan

-STATUTE-
    (a) Goals
      The final system plan shall be formulated in such a way as to
    effectuate the following goals:
        (1) the creation, through a process of reorganization, of a
      financially self-sustaining rail and express service system in
      the region;
        (2) the establishment and maintenance of a rail service system
      adequate to meet the rail transportation needs and service
      requirements of the region;
        (3) the establishment of improved high-speed rail passenger
      service, consonant with the recommendations of the Secretary in
      his report of September 1971, entitled "Recommendations for
      Northeast Corridor Transportation";
        (4) the preservation, to the extent consistent with other
      goals, of existing patterns of service by railroads (including
      short-line and terminal railroads), and of existing railroad
      trackage in areas in which fossil fuel natural resources are
      located, and the utilization of those modes of transportation in
      the region which require the smallest amount of scarce energy
      resources and which can most efficiently transport energy
      resources;
        (5) the retention and promotion of competition in the provision
      of rail and other transportation services in the region;
        (6) the attainment and maintenance of any environmental
      standards, particularly the applicable national ambient air
      quality standards and plans established under the Clean Air Act
      Amendments of 1970, taking into consideration the environmental
      impact of alternative choices of action;
        (7) the movement of passengers and freight in rail
      transportation in the region in the most efficient manner
      consistent with safe operation, including the requirements of
      commuter and intercity rail passenger service; the extent to
      which there should be coordination with the National Railroad
      Passenger Corporation and similar entities; and the
      identification of all short-to-medium distance corridors in
      densely populated areas in which the major upgrading of rail
      lines for high-speed passenger operation would return substantial
      public benefits; and
        (8) the minimization of job losses and associated increases in
      unemployment and community benefit costs in areas in the region
      presently served by rail service.
    (b) Factors
      The final system plan shall be based upon due consideration of
    all factors relevant to the realization of the goals set forth in
    subsection (a) of this section. Such factors include the need for
    and the cost of rehabilitation and modernization of track,
    equipment, and other facilities; methods of achieving economies in
    the cost of rail operations in the region; means of achieving
    rationalization of rail services and the rail service system in the
    region; marketing studies; the impact on railroad employees;
    consumer needs; traffic analyses; financial studies; and any other
    factors identified by the Association under section 712(b) (!1) of
    this title or in the report of the Secretary required under section
    714(a) of this title.

    (c) Designations
      The final system plan shall designate - 
        (1) which rail properties of railroads in reorganization in the
      region or of railroads leased, operated, or controlled by any
      railroad in reorganization in the region - 
          (A) shall be transferred to the Corporation: Provided, That
        the Corporation shall, within 95 days after the effective date
        of the final system plan, give notice to the Association of
        which such rail properties, if any, are to be transferred to a
        subsidiary of the Corporation in the event that the Board of
        Directors of the Association finds that such transfer would be
        consistent with the final system plan;
          (B) shall be offered for sale to a profitable railroad
        operating in the region and, if such offer is accepted,
        operated by such railroad; the plan shall designate what
        additions shall be made to the designation under subparagraph
        (A) of this paragraph and what alternative designations shall
        be made under this paragraph in the event such profitable
        railroad fails to accept such offer;
          (C) shall be purchased, leased, or otherwise acquired from
        the Corporation by the National Railroad Passenger Corporation
        in accordance with the exercise of its option under section
        791(d) of this title for improvement to achieve the goal set
        forth in subsection (a)(3) of this section;
          (D) may be purchased or leased from the Corporation by (i) a
        State or a local or regional transportation authority to meet
        the needs of commuter and intercity rail passenger service, or
        (ii) the National Railroad Passenger Corporation to meet the
        needs of improved rail passenger service over intercity routes,
        other than properties designated pursuant to subparagraph (C)
        of this paragraph; and
          (E) if not otherwise required to be operated by the
        Corporation, a government entity, or a responsible person, are
        suitable for use for other public purposes, including highways,
        other forms of transportation, conservation, energy
        transmission, education or health care facilities, or
        recreation. In carrying out this subparagraph, the Association
        shall solicit the views and recommendations of the Secretary,
        the Secretary of the Interior, the Administrator of the
        Environmental Protection Agency, and other agencies of the
        Federal Government and of the States and political subdivisions
        thereof within the region, and the general public; and

        (2) which rail properties of profitable railroads operating in
      the region may be offered for sale to the Corporation or to other
      profitable railroads operating in the region subject to
      paragraphs (3) and (4) of subsection (d) of this section. Any
      rail properties designated to be offered for sale to the
      Corporation may be sold instead to a subsidiary of the
      Corporation.
    (d) Transfers
      All transfers or conveyances pursuant to the final system plan
    shall be made in accordance with, and subject to, the following
    principles:
        (1) All rail properties to be transferred to the Corporation or
      any subsidiary thereof by a profitable railroad, by trustees of a
      railroad in reorganization, or by any railroad leased, operated,
      or controlled by a railroad in reorganization in the region,
      shall be transferred in exchange for stock and other securities
      of the Corporation or any subsidiary thereof (including
      obligations of the Association) and the other benefits accruing
      to such railroad by reason of such transfer.
        (2) All rail properties to be conveyed to a profitable railroad
      operating in the region by trustees of a railroad in
      reorganization, or by any railroad leased, operated, or
      controlled by a railroad in reorganization in the region, shall
      be conveyed in exchange for compensation from the profitable
      railroad.
        (3) Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, no
      acquisition under this chapter shall be made by any profitable
      railroad operating in the region without a determination with
      respect to each such transaction and all such transactions
      cumulatively (A) by the Association, upon adoption and release of
      the preliminary system plan, that such acquisition or
      acquisitions will not materially impair the profitability of any
      other profitable railroad operating in the region or of the
      Corporation, and (B) by the Commission, which shall be made
      within 90 days after adoption and release by the Association of
      the preliminary system plan, that such acquisition or
      acquisitions will be in full accord and comply with the
      provisions and standards of subchapter III (!2) of chapter 113 of
      title 49. All determinations made by the Association in the
      correction to the preliminary system plan published on April 11,
      1975 (40 Fed. Reg. 16377), shall be treated for all purposes as
      if they had been made upon adoption and release by the
      Association of the preliminary system plan. All determinations
      made by the Commission with respect to such correction shall be
      treated for all purposes as if they had been made within 90 days
      after adoption and release by the Association of the preliminary
      system plan. All determinations made by the Commission with
      respect to acquisitions by profitable railroads referred to in
      any supplement to the preliminary system plan published under
      section 717(b)(2) of this title shall be deemed to be timely if
      made prior to the adoption of the final system plan under section
      717(c) of this title. The determination by the Association shall
      not be reviewable in any court. The determination by the
      Commission shall not be reviewable in any court.

        (4) Where the final system plan designates specified rail
      properties of a railroad in reorganization in the region, or of a
      railroad leased, operated, or controlled by a railroad in
      reorganization in the region, to be offered for sale to and
      operated by a profitable railroad operating in the region, such
      designation shall terminate 7 days after February 5, 1976,
      unless, prior to such date, such profitable railroad has notified
      the Association in writing of its acceptance of such offer. Any
      such offer may be modified until the date of acceptance thereof,
      unless such modification results in an offer for the sale of rail
      properties at less than the net liquidation value thereof. Where
      the final system plan designates specified rail properties of a
      profitable railroad operating in the region as authorized to be
      offered for sale or lease to the Corporation or to other
      profitable railroads operating in the region, such designation
      and authorization shall terminate 95 days after the effective
      date of the final system plan unless, prior to such date, a
      binding agreement with respect to such properties has been
      entered into and concluded.
        (5) All properties - 
          (A) transferred by the Corporation pursuant to subsection
        (c)(1)(C) of this section and section 791(d) of this title;
          (B) transferred by the Corporation to any State (or local or
        regional transportation authority), pursuant to subsection
        (c)(1)(D) of this section, or
          (C) transferred by the Corporation to any State, local or
        regional transportation authority, or the National Railroad
        Passenger Corporation, within 3 years after the date of
        conveyance, pursuant to section 743(b)(1) of this title, to
        meet the needs of commuter or intercity rail passenger service,

      shall be transferred at a value related to the value received
      from the Corporation pursuant to the final system plan for the
      transfer to such Corporation of such properties. The value of any
      such properties, which are transferred pursuant to subparagraph
      (B) or (C) of this paragraph, shall be adjusted to reflect the
      value attributable to any applicable maintenance and improvement
      provided by the Corporation (to the extent the Corporation has
      not been released from the obligation to pay for such
      improvements) and the cost to the Corporation of transferring
      such properties. The Corporation, its Board of Directors, and its
      individual directors shall not be liable to any party, for money
      damages or in any other manner, solely by reason of the fact that
      the Corporation transferred property pursuant to section 743 of
      this title to meet the needs of commuter or intercity rail
      passenger service or for purposes of providing rail marine
      freight floating service, except as otherwise provided with
      respect to the Corporation pursuant to section 743(c)(2) of this
      title.
        (6) Notwithstanding any statement to the contrary in the final
      system plan, a State (or a local or regional transportation
      authority) shall not be required to deliver to the Corporation a
      firm commitment to acquire rail properties designated to such
      State or authority prior to 7 days after February 5, 1976.
        (7) Notwithstanding any contrary provision in the options
      conveyed to the Corporation by railroads in reorganization, or
      railroads leased, operated, or controlled by a railroad in
      reorganization, with respect to the acquisition by the
      Corporation pursuant to the final system plan, on behalf of a
      State (or a local or regional transportation authority) of rail
      properties designated under subsection (c)(1)(D) of this section,
      such options shall not be deemed to have expired prior to 7 days
      after September 30, 1976. The exercise by the Corporation of any
      such option shall be effective if it is made, prior to the
      expiration of such 7-day period, in the manner prescribed in such
      options.
    (e) Corporation features
      The final system plan shall set forth - 
        (1) pro forma earnings for the Corporation, as reasonably
      projected and considering the additions or changes in the
      designation of rail properties to be operated by the Corporation
      which may be made under subsection (d)(4) of this section;
        (2) the capital structure of the Corporation, based on the pro
      forma earnings of the Corporation as set forth, including such
      debt capitalization as shall be reasonably deemed to conform to
      the requirements of the public interest with respect to railroad
      debt securities, including the adequacy of coverage of fixed
      charges; and
        (3) the manner in which employee stock ownership plans may, to
      the extent practicable, be utilized for meeting the
      capitalization requirements of the Corporation, taking into
      account (A) the relative cost savings compared to conventional
      methods of corporate finance; (B) the labor cost savings; (C) the
      potential for minimizing strikes and producing more harmonious
      relations between labor organizations and railway management; (D)
      the projected employee dividend incomes; (E) the impact on
      quality of service and prices to railway users; and (F) the
      promotion of the objectives of this chapter of creating a
      financially self-sustaining railway system in the region which
      also meets the service needs of the region and the Nation.
    (f) Value
      The final system plan shall designate the value of all rail
    properties to be transferred under the final system plan and the
    value of the securities and other benefits to be received for
    transferring those rail properties to the Corporation in accordance
    with the final system plan.
    (g) Other provisions
      The final system plan may recommend arrangements among various
    railroads for joint use or operation of rail properties on a shared
    ownership, cooperative, pooled, or condominium-type basis, subject
    to such terms and conditions as may be specified in the final
    system plan. The final system plan shall also make such
    designations as are determined to be necessary in accordance with
    the provisions of section 762 or 763 (!3) of this title.

    (h) Obligational authority
      The final system plan shall recommend the amount of obligations
    of the Association which are necessary to enable it to implement
    the final system plan.
    (i) Terms and conditions for securities
      The final system plan may include terms and conditions for any
    securities to be issued by the Corporation in exchange for the
    conveyance of rail properties under the final system plan which in
    the judgement of the Association will minimize any actual or
    potential debt burden on the Corporation. Any such terms and
    conditions for securities of the Corporation which purport to
    directly obligate the Association shall not become effective
    without affirmative approval, with or without modification by a
    joint resolution of the Congress.
    (j) Additional properties deemed designated
      Any rail properties over which rail service was being provided as
    of February 5, 1976, and which were recommended in the preliminary
    system plan for transfer to the Corporation, shall be deemed to be
    designated in the final system plan for transfer to the Corporation
    under subsection (c)(1)(A) of this section. Any designation in the
    final system plan, pursuant to subsection (c)(1)(B) of this
    section, of overhead trackage rights to be acquired by a profitable
    railroad operating in the region over specified rail properties to
    be acquired by the Corporation, where such designation does not (1)
    authorize such profitable railroad to interchange traffic with at
    least one railroad, or (2) provide for the connection of portions
    of such profitable railroad's rail properties, and where the
    transfer of ownership of such rail properties (including trackage
    rights) to such profitable railroad was recommended in the
    preliminary system plan, and the Commission has made a
    determination with respect thereto, in accordance with subsection
    (d)(3) of this section, shall be deemed to authorize such
    profitable railroad to interchange traffic with the Corporation and
    any other profitable railroad connecting with such specified rail
    properties.

    TITLE 45 - RAILROADS
    CHAPTER 16 - REGIONAL RAIL REORGANIZATION
    SUBCHAPTER II - UNITED STATES RAILWAY ASSOCIATION

-HEAD-
    Sec. 717. Adoption of final system plan

-STATUTE-
    (a) Preliminary system plan
      (1) Within 420 days after January 2, 1974, the Association shall
    adopt and release a preliminary system plan prepared by it on the
    basis of reports and other information submitted to it by the
    Secretary, the Office, and interested persons in accordance with
    this chapter and on the basis of its own investigations,
    consultations, research, evaluation, and analysis pursuant to this
    chapter. Copies of the preliminary system plan shall be transmitted
    by the Association to the Secretary, the Office, the Governor and
    public utility commission of each State in the region, the
    Congress, each court having jurisdiction over a railroad in
    reorganization in the region, the special court, and interested
    persons, and a copy shall be published in the Federal Register. The
    Association shall invite and afford interested persons an
    opportunity to submit comments on the preliminary system plan to
    the Association within 60 days after the date of its release.
      (2) The Office is authorized and directed to hold public hearings
    on the preliminary system plan and to make available to the
    Association a summary and analysis of the evidence received in the
    course of such proceedings, together with its critique and
    evaluation of the preliminary system plan, not later than 60 days
    after the date of release of such plan. The Office is authorized to
    hold public hearings on any supplement to the preliminary system
    plan and to make available to the Association a summary and
    analysis of the evidence received in the course of such
    proceedings, together with its critique and evaluation of such
    supplement, not later than 30 days after the release of such
    supplement.
    (b) Approval
      (1) Within 120 days after January 2, 1974, each United States
    district court or other court having jurisdiction over a railroad
    in reorganization shall decide whether the railroad is
    reorganizable on an income basis within a reasonable time under
    section 77 of the Bankruptcy Act and that the public interest would
    be better served by continuing the present reorganization
    proceedings than by a reorganization under this chapter. Within 60
    days after the submission of the report by the Office, under
    section 715(d)(1) of this title, on the Secretary's report on rail
    services in the region, each United States district court or other
    court having jurisdiction over a railroad in reorganization shall
    decide whether or not such railroad shall be reorganized by means
    of transferring some of its rail properties to the Corporation
    pursuant to the provisions of this chapter. Because of the strong
    public interest in the continuance of rail transportation in the
    region pursuant to a system plan devised under the provisions of
    this chapter, each such court shall order that the reorganization
    be proceeded with pursuant to this chapter unless it (1) has found
    that the railroad is reorganizable on an income basis within a
    reasonable time under section 77 of the Bankruptcy Act and that the
    public interest would be better served by such a reorganization
    than by a reorganization under this chapter, or (2) finds that this
    chapter does not provide a process which would be fair and
    equitable to the estate of the railroad in reorganization in which
    case it shall dismiss the reorganization proceeding. If a court
    does not enter an order or make a finding as required by this
    subsection, the reorganization shall be proceeded with pursuant to
    this chapter. An appeal from an order made under this section may
    be made only to the special court. Appeal to the special court
    shall be taken within 10 days following entry of an order pursuant
    to this subsection, and the special court shall complete its review
    and render its decision within 80 days after such appeal is taken.
    There shall be no review of the decision of the special court.
      (2) Whenever it has been finally determined pursuant to the
    procedures of paragraph (1) of this subsection, that the
    reorganization of a railroad subject to reorganization under
    section 77 of the Bankruptcy Act shall not be proceeded with
    pursuant to this chapter, the court having jurisdiction over such
    railroad may, upon a petition which is filed within 10 days after
    February 28, 1975, by the trustees of such railroad, reconsider
    such order. Such reorganization court shall (i) affirm its previous
    order or (ii) issue an order that the reorganization of such
    railroad be proceeded with pursuant to this chapter unless it finds
    that this chapter does not provide a process which would be fair
    and equitable. The provisions of paragraph (1) of this subsection
    are applicable in such reconsideration, except that (A) such
    reorganization court shall make its decision within 30 days after
    such petition is filed, and (B) any decision by the special court
    on appeal from such a decision shall be rendered within 30 days
    after such reorganization court decision is made. There shall be no
    review of the decision of the special court. The Association shall
    take any steps it finds necessary, consistent with time limitations
    and other provisions of this chapter, to effectuate the
    consequences of such a revised order, including the preparation and
    submission of any necessary or appropriate supplements to the
    preliminary system plan.
    (c) Adoption
      Within 540 days after January 2, 1974, the executive committee of
    the Association shall prepare and submit a final system plan for
    the approval of the Board of Directors of the Association. A copy
    of such submission shall be simultaneously presented to the
    Commission. The submission shall reflect evaluation of all
    responses and summaries of responses received, testimony at any
    public hearings, and the results of additional study and review.
    Within 30 days thereafter, the Board of Directors of the
    Association shall by a majority vote of all its members approve a
    final system plan which meets all of the requirements of section
    716 of this title.
    (d) Review of Commission
      Within 30 days following the adoption of the final system plan by
    the Association under subsection (c) of this section and the
    submission of such plan to Congress under section 718(a) of this
    title, the Commission shall submit to the Congress an evaluation of
    the final system plan delivered to both Houses of Congress.

    SUBCHAPTER II - UNITED STATES RAILWAY ASSOCIATION

-HEAD-
    Sec. 718. Review by Congress

-STATUTE-
    (a) General
      The Board of Directors of the Association shall deliver the final
    system plan adopted by the Association to both Houses of Congress
    and to the Committee on Energy and Commerce of the House of
    Representatives and the Committee on Commerce, Science, and
    Transportation of the Senate. The final system plan shall be deemed
    approved at the end of the first period of 60 calendar days of
    continuous session of Congress after such date of transmittal
    unless either the House of Representatives or the Senate passes a
    resolution during such period stating that it does not favor the
    final system plan.
    (b) Revised plan
      If either the House or the Senate passes a resolution of
    disapproval under subsection (a) of this section, the Association,
    with the cooperation and assistance of the Secretary and the
    Office, shall prepare, determine, and adopt a revised final system
    plan. Each such revised plan shall be submitted to Congress for
    review pursuant to subsection (a) of this section.
    (c) Computation
      For purposes of this section - 
        (1) continuity of session of Congress is broken only by an
      adjournment sine die; and
        (2) the days on which either House is not in session because of
      an adjournment of more than 3 days to a day certain are excluded
      in the computation of the 60-day period.
    (d) Additions
      (1) The supplemental report, dated September 18, 1975, to the
    final system plan, and the provisions of the Association's official
    errata supplement to the final system plan, dated December 1, 1975,
    including all designations made therein, shall be treated for all
    purposes as if they had been part of and included in the final
    system plan adopted by the Association and reviewed by the
    Congress. The final system plan shall, for all purposes, be deemed
    to be approved as modified and amended by such supplemental report
    and such supplement.
      (2) The Association may, upon petition of any State, modify the
    final system plan to make further designations with respect to rail
    properties of railroads in reorganization in the region designated
    for transfer to the Corporation under such plan, if such
    designations (A) are likely to result in improved rail service on
    such rail properties and connecting rail properties, and (B) would
    not materially impair the profitability of the Corporation. Such
    designations, including designations of such rail properties to a
    State, a profitable railroad, or a responsible person, may be made
    at any time prior to delivery of the final system plan to the
    special court under section 719(c) of this title. Such further
    designations shall be treated for all purposes as if they had been
    included in the final system plan adopted by the Association and
    reviewed by the Congress, and the final system plan shall for all
    purposes be deemed to be approved as modified by such designations.
    Any action of the Association with respect to any such petition
    shall not be subject to review by any court.
      (3)(A) Within 20 days after February 5, 1976, the Association
    may, by notice to the Congress and by publication in the Federal
    Register, modify, supplement, or add to the designations of rail
    properties in the final system plan if the Association finds such
    actions are necessary to - 
        (i) achieve the efficient implementation of the final system
      plan, or
        (ii) provide for the offer to profitable railroads of rail
      properties designated in the final system plan to the
      Corporation, if such properties are not essential in the
      operation of other rail properties of the Corporation but are or
      would be integrally related to the operation of rail properties
      of (or which are offered pursuant to the final system plan to)
      such profitable railroad, or
        (iii) provide for the designation of additional rail properties
      to the Corporation or to a subsidiary thereof to enable the
      Corporation to serve efficiently a line of railroad designated to
      the Corporation in the final system plan if such line does not
      connect with any other line of railroad so designated to the
      Corporation or if such line would be served more efficiently as a
      consequence of such designation.

    Any designation to a profitable railroad pursuant to this paragraph
    shall comply with the second sentence of section 716(d)(4) of this
    title, and shall only be made upon a finding by the Association
    that such designation is integrally related to an offer of rail
    properties to a profitable railroad in the final system plan, that
    the goals of the final system plan require that the rail properties
    be operated as a part of the rail properties included in such
    offer, and that the implementation of such designation will not
    materially and adversely affect the impact of such offer on the
    profitability of the Corporation or any profitable railroad
    operating in the region. Any designation to a profitable railroad
    pursuant to this subsection, which amends any prior offer, shall
    terminate 30 days after February 5, 1976, unless, prior to such
    date, such profitable railroad has notified the Association in
    writing of its acceptance of such amendment to the prior offer.
      (B) If a line of railroad or any segment thereof is designated
    for rail service in the final system plan, no designation may be
    made by the Association pursuant to this paragraph which would
    result in such line or segment not being so designated. Any
    designations made pursuant to this paragraph shall be treated for
    all purposes as if they had been included in the final system plan
    adopted by the Association and reviewed by the Congress. The final
    system plan shall for all purposes be deemed to be approved as
    amended by such designations.
      (C) Any designations made pursuant to this paragraph shall not be
    subject to review by any court.
      (D) Any labor agreements entered into under section 778 (!1) of
    this title shall be subject to further negotiations for any
    modifications which may be necessary to implement designations made
    pursuant to this paragraph.

    Sec. 719. Judicial review

-STATUTE-
    (a) General
      Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the final system plan
    which is adopted by the Association and which becomes effective
    after review by the Congress is not subject to review by any court
    except in accordance with this section. After the final system plan
    becomes effective under section 718 of this title, it may be
    reviewed with respect to matters concerning the value of the rail
    properties to be conveyed under the plan and the value of the
    consideration to be received for such properties.
    (b) Special court
      (1) Within 30 days after January 2, 1974, the Association shall
    make application to the judicial panel on multi-district litigation
    authorized by section 1407 of title 28 for the consolidation in a
    single, three-judge district court of the United States of all
    judicial proceedings with respect to the final system plan. Within
    30 days after such application is received, the panel shall make
    the consolidation in a district court (cited herein as the "special
    court") which the panel determines to be convenient to the parties
    and the one most likely to be able to conduct any proceedings under
    this section with the least delay and the greatest possible
    fairness and ability. Such proceedings shall be conducted by the
    special court which shall be composed of three Federal judges who
    shall be selected by the panel, except that none of the judges
    selected may be a judge assigned to a proceeding involving any
    railroad in reorganization in the region under section 77 of the
    Bankruptcy Act. The special court is authorized to exercise the
    powers of a district judge in any judicial district with respect to
    such proceedings and such powers shall include those of a
    reorganization court. The special court shall have the power to
    order the conveyance of rail properties of railroads leased,
    operated, or controlled by a railroad in reorganization in the
    region. The special court may issue rules for the conduct of any
    proceedings under this section and under section 745 of this title,
    including rules with respect to the time within which motions may
    be filed, and with respect to appropriate representation of
    interests not otherwise represented (including the Secretary with
    respect to a petition by the Association in the case of a proposal
    developed by the Secretary, under such section 745 of this title).
    No determination by the panel under this subsection may be reviewed
    in any court.
      (2) The special court referred to in paragraph (1) of this
    subsection is abolished effective 90 days after October 19, 1996.
    On such effective date, all jurisdiction and other functions of the
    special court shall be assumed by the United States District Court
    for the District of Columbia. With respect to any proceedings that
    arise or continue after the date on which the special court is
    abolished, the references in the following provisions to the
    special court established under this subsection shall be deemed to
    refer to the United States District Court for the District of
    Columbia:

        (F) Any other Federal law (other than this subsection and
      section 605 of the Federal Courts Improvement Act of 1996),
      Executive order, rule, regulation, delegation of authority, or
      document of or relating to the special court as previously
      established under paragraph (1) of this subsection.
    (c) Delivery of plan to special court
      Within 90 days after its effective date, the Association shall
    deliver a certified copy of the final system plan to the special
    court and shall certify to the special court - 
        (1) which rail properties of the respective railroads in
      reorganization in the region and of any person leased, operated,
      or controlled by such railroads in reorganization are to be
      transferred to the Corporation, or any subsidiary thereof, in
      accordance with the final system plan;
        (2) which rail properties of the respective railroads in
      reorganization in the region or person leased,(!1) operated, or
      controlled by such railroads in reorganization are to be conveyed
      to profitable railroads, in accordance with the final system
      plan;

        (3) the amount, terms, and value of the securities of the
      Corporation or any subsidiary thereof (including any certificates
      of value of the Association) to be exchanged for those rail
      properties to be transferred to the Corporation or any subsidiary
      thereof pursuant to the final system plan, and as indicated in
      paragraph (1) of this subsection; and
        (4) that the transfer of rail properties in exchange for
      securities of the Corporation or any subsidiary thereof
      (including any certificates of value of the Association) and
      other benefits is fair and equitable and in the public interest.

    Notwithstanding any other provisions of this subsection and
    subsection (d) of this section, the time for the delivery of a
    certified copy of the final system plan shall be March 12, 1976,
    and may be extended to a date not more than 30 days thereafter,
    prescribed in a notice filed by the Association not later than
    February 17, 1976, with the special court, the Congress, and each
    court referred to in such subsection (d) of this section. Such
    notice shall contain the certification of the Association that an
    orderly conveyance of rail properties cannot reasonably be effected
    before the date for conveyance determined with respect to such
    notice. The time prescribed in section 743(a) of this title shall
    be determined with respect to the date prescribed in such notice.
    (d) Bankruptcy courts
      Within 90 days after its effective date, the Association shall
    deliver a certified copy of the final system plan to each district
    court of the United States or any other court having jurisdiction
    over a railroad in reorganization in the region and shall certify
    to each such court - 
        (1) which rail properties of that railroad in reorganization
      are to be transferred to the Corporation or any subsidiary
      thereof under the final system plan; and
        (2) which rail properties of that railroad in reorganization,
      if any, are to be conveyed to profitable railroads operating in
      the region, under the final system plan.
    (e) Original and exclusive jurisdiction
      (1) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, any civil action -
     
        (A) for injunctive or other relief against the Association from
      the enforcement, operation, or execution of this chapter or any
      provision thereof, or from any action taken by the Association
      pursuant to authority conferred or purportedly conferred under
      this chapter;
        (B) challenging the constitutionality of this chapter or any
      provision thereof;
        (C) challenging the legality of any action of the Association,
      or any failure of the Association to take any action, pursuant to
      authority conferred or purportedly conferred under this chapter;
        (D) to obtain, inspect, copy, or review any document in the
      possession or control of the Association that would be
      discoverable in litigation pursuant to section 743(c) of this
      title;
        (E) brought after a conveyance, pursuant to section 743(b) of
      this title, to set aside or annul such conveyance or to secure in
      any way the reconveyance of any rail properties so conveyed; or
        (F) with respect to continuing reorganization and supplemental
      transactions, in accordance with section 745 of this title;

    shall be within the original and exclusive jurisdiction of the
    special court. The special court shall not hear or determine any
    such action prior to the date of conveyance, pursuant to section
    743(b)(1) of this title, except as the Constitution may require.
    Relief shall not be granted in any action referred to in
    subparagraph (A), (C), or (E) unless the person seeking such relief
    establishes that the Association acted in reckless or deliberate
    disregard of applicable law.
      (2) The original and exclusive jurisdiction of the special court
    shall include any action, whether filed by any interested person or
    initiated by the special court itself, to interpret, alter, amend,
    modify, or implement any of the orders entered by such court
    pursuant to section 743(b) of this title in order to effect the
    purposes of this chapter or the goals of the final system plan.
    During the pendency of any proceeding described in this paragraph,
    the special court may enter such orders as it determines to be
    appropriate, including orders enjoining, restraining, conditioning,
    or limiting any conveyance, transfer, or use of any asset or right
    which is subject to such an order or which is at issue in such a
    proceeding, or which involves the enforcement of any liens or
    encumbrances upon such assets or rights. Any orders pursuant to
    this paragraph which interpret, alter, amend, modify, or implement
    orders entered by the special court shall be final and shall not be
    restrained or enjoined by any court.
      (3) An order or judgment of the United States District Court for
    the District of Columbia in any action referred to in this section
    shall be reviewable in accordance with sections 1291, 1292, and
    1294 of title 28.
    (f) Disposition of cash deposits
      Whenever the compensation which is deposited with the special
    court under section 743(a) of this title is in the form of cash,
    such cash shall be invested and reinvested upon such terms and
    conditions as the special court shall determine, pending the making
    of the findings referred to in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of
    section 743(c) of this title. Notwithstanding section 743(c)(4) of
    this title, the special court may order (1) the income from such
    investments, (2) the dividends or interest, if any, received on any
    securities or obligations deposited with the special court under
    such section 743(a) of this title, and (3) the income, if any,
    received with respect to any other form of compensation so
    deposited, to be distributed to the trustee of each railroad in
    reorganization and to any person leased, operated or controlled by
    such a railroad which conveyed the right, title, and interest in
    the rail properties with respect to which such cash, securities,
    obligations, or other compensation have been so deposited with the
    special court. Notwithstanding section 743(c)(4) of this title, the
    special court may, within 90 days after the date of conveyance of
    rail properties pursuant to section 743(b) of this title, order up
    to 25 percent of any cash (including investments made with cash)
    and other compensation deposited with the special court to be
    distributed to such trustee or person. On petition of the
    applicable trustee or person, the special court may order such
    additional distributions as it finds reasonable and appropriate,
    prior to the making of the findings referred to in paragraphs (1),
    (2), and (3) of such section 743(c) of this title.
    (g) Stay of court proceedings
      The special court may stay or enjoin any action or proceeding in
    any State court or in any court of the United States other than the
    Supreme Court or Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia
    Circuit if such action or proceeding is contrary to any provision
    of this chapter, impairs the effective implementation of this
    chapter, or interferes with the execution of any order of the
    special court pursuant to this chapter.

    section 607(s) requiring substitution of "person leased" for
    "railroad leased".

-HEAD-
    Sec. 720. Obligations of Association

-STATUTE-
    (a) General
      To carry out the purposes of this chapter, the Association is
    authorized to issue bonds, debentures, trust certificates,
    securities, or other obligations (herein cited as "obligations") in
    accordance with this section. Such obligations shall have such
    maturities and bear such rate or rates of interest as are
    determined by the Association with the approval of the Secretary of
    the Treasury. Such obligations shall be redeemable at the option of
    the Association prior to maturity in the manner stipulated in each
    such obligation, and may be purchased by the Association in the
    open market at a price which is reasonable.
    (b) Maximum obligational authority
      The aggregate principal amount (exclusive of interest or
    additions to principal on account of accrual of interest) of
    obligations issued by the Association under this section which may
    be outstanding at any one time shall not exceed $395,000,000. No
    obligations or proceeds thereof shall be issued or made available
    after February 5, 1976, except - 
        (1) to meet existing or potential commitments for loans under
      section 721 of this title made or applied for prior to January 1,
      1976; and
        (2) for the purpose of providing loans pursuant to subsections
      (g) and (h) of section 721 of this title.
    (c) Guarantees
      The Secretary shall guarantee the payment of principal and
    interest on all obligations issued by the Association in accordance
    with this chapter and which the Association requests be guaranteed.
    All guarantees entered into by the Secretary under this section
    shall constitute general obligations of the United States for the
    payment of which its full faith and credit are pledged.
    (d) Validity
      No obligation issued by the Association under this section shall
    be terminated, canceled, or otherwise revoked, except in accordance
    with lawful terms and conditions prescribed by the Association.
    Such an obligation shall be conclusive evidence that it is in
    compliance with this section, has been approved, and is legal as to
    principal, interest, and other terms. An obligation of the
    Association shall be valid and incontestable in the hands of a
    holder, except as to fraud, duress, mutual mistake of fact, or
    material misrepresentation by or involving such holder.
    (e) The Secretary of the Treasury
      If at any time the moneys available to the Secretary are
    insufficient to enable him to discharge his responsibilities under
    subsection (c) of this section or under subsection (a) of section
    746 of this title, he shall issue notes or other obligations to the
    Secretary of the Treasury in such forms and denominations, bearing
    such maturities, and subject to such terms and conditions as may be
    prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury. Such obligations shall
    bear interest at a rate to be determined by the Secretary of the
    Treasury taking into consideration the current average market yield
    on outstanding marketable obligations of the United States of
    comparable maturities during the month preceding the issuance of
    such obligations. The Secretary of the Treasury is authorized and
    directed to purchase any such obligations and for such purposes is
    authorized to use as a public debt transaction the proceeds from
    the sale of any securities issued under chapter 31 of title 31. The
    purposes for which securities may be issued under such chapter are
    extended to include any purchase of notes or other obligations
    issued under this subsection. At any time, the Secretary of the
    Treasury may sell any such obligations, and all sales, purchases,
    and redemptions of such obligations by the Secretary of the
    Treasury shall be treated as public debt transactions of the United
    States.
    (f) Authorization for appropriations
      There are hereby authorized to be appropriated to the Secretary
    such amounts as are necessary to discharge the obligations of the
    United States arising under this section.
    (g) Lawful investments
      All obligations issued by the Association shall be lawful
    investments and may be accepted as security for all fiduciary,
    trust, and public funds, the investment or deposit of which shall
    be under the authority and control of the United States or any
    officer or officers thereof. All such obligations issued pursuant
    to this section shall be exempt securities within the meaning of
    laws administered by the Securities and Exchange Commission.

    CHAPTER 16 - REGIONAL RAIL REORGANIZATION
    SUBCHAPTER II - UNITED STATES RAILWAY ASSOCIATION

-HEAD-
    Sec. 721. Loans

-STATUTE-
    (a) General
      The Association is authorized, in accordance with the provisions
    of this section and such rules and regulations as it shall
    prescribe, to make loans to the Corporation, the National Railroad
    Passenger Corporation, and other railroads (including a railroad in
    reorganization which has been found to be reorganizable under
    section 77 of the Bankruptcy Act pursuant to section 717(b) of this
    title) in the region, for purposes of achieving the goals of this
    chapter; to a State or local or regional transportation authority
    pursuant to section 763 (!1) of this title; and to provide
    assistance in the form of loans to any railroad which (A) connects
    with a railroad in reorganization, and (B) is in need of financial
    assistance to avoid reorganization proceedings under section 77 of
    the Bankruptcy Act. No such loan shall be made by the Association
    to a railroad unless such loans shall, where applicable, be treated
    as an expense of administration. The rights referred to in the last
    sentence of section 77(j) of the Bankruptcy Act shall in no way be
    affected by this chapter.

    (b) Applications
      Each application for such a loan shall be made in writing to the
    Association in such form and with such content and other
    submissions as the Association shall prescribe to protect
    reasonably the interests of the United States. The Association
    shall publish a notice of the receipt of each such application in
    the Federal Register and shall afford interested persons an
    opportunity to comment thereon.
    (c) Terms and conditions
      Each loan shall be extended in such form, under such terms and
    conditions, and pursuant to such regulations as the Association
    deems appropriate. Such loan shall bear interest at a rate not less
    than the greater of a rate determined by the Secretary of the
    Treasury taking into consideration (1) the rate prevailing in the
    private market for similar loans as determined by the Secretary of
    the Treasury, or (2) the current average yield on outstanding
    marketable obligations of the Association with remaining periods of
    maturity comparable to the average maturities of such loans, plus
    such additional charge, if any, toward covering costs of the
    Association as the Association may determine to be consistent with
    the purposes of this chapter.
    (d) Modifications
      The Association is authorized to approve any modification of any
    provision of a loan under this section, including the rate of
    interest, time of payment of interest or principal, security, or
    any other term or condition, upon agreement of the recipient of the
    loan and upon a finding by the Association that such modification
    is equitable and necessary or appropriate to achieve the policy
    declared in subsection (f) of this section. Notwithstanding any
    other provision of this section, in the case of a loan made under
    subsection (a) of this section to a railroad in the region, the
    Association is not required to make the findings with respect to
    subsections (e)(3) and (f) of this section and may, upon the
    request of such railroad - 
        (1) continue to make advances to such railroad pursuant to such
      loan, up to the total principal provided, as of November 8, 1978,
      under the agreement between such railroad and the Association
      under this section, upon finding only that (A) a good faith
      effort has been commenced by such railroad toward the
      establishment of an employee stock ownership plan, and (B) such
      continued advances will permit the continuation of rail service
      determined by the Association, in the Final System Plan or under
      the goals of this chapter, to be desirable; and
        (2) increase the principal amount of such loan to such
      railroad, in an amount not to exceed $7,500,000, only if the
      Association makes the finding referred to in paragraph (1)(B) of
      this subsection and determines that such railroad is making a
      good faith effort to establish an employee stock ownership plan
      for review and approval by the Association. Any such approval
      shall be conditioned upon a written commitment that by December
      31, 1980, the railroad will adopt an employee stock ownership
      plan which will acquire qualifying employer securities with a
      fair market value of $250,000.

    The Association may not take any action pursuant to the preceding
    sentence of this subsection after December 31, 1981.
    (e) Prerequisites
      The Association shall make a finding in writing, before making a
    loan to any applicant under this section, that - 
        (1) the loan is necessary to achieve the goals of this chapter
      or to prevent insolvency;
        (2) it is satisfied that the business affairs of the applicant
      will be conducted in a reasonable and prudent manner; and
        (3) the applicant has offered such security as the Association
      deems necessary to protect reasonably the interests of the United
      States.
    (f) Policy
      It is the intent of Congress that loans made under this section
    shall be made on terms and conditions which furnish reasonable
    assurance that the Corporation or the railroads to which such loans
    are granted will be able to repay them within the time fixed and
    that the goals of this chapter are reasonably likely to be
    achieved.
    (g) Pre-conveyance loans to Corporation
      During the period between the effective date of the final system
    plan and the date of the conveyance of rail properties pursuant to
    section 743(b) of this title, the Association may make such loans
    in such amounts to the Corporation as the Association deems
    essential to provide for the purchase by the Corporation of
    material, supplies, equipment, and services necessary to permit the
    orderly and efficient implementation of the final system plan.
    Notwithstanding any inability of the Association during such period
    to make the finding required by subsection (e)(3) of this section
    because of any existing contingencies, the Association may make any
    such loans to the Corporation, subject to - 
        (1) the most favorable terms and conditions for assuring timely
      repayment and security as may then be reasonably available, and
        (2) the requirement that any loan to the Corporation under this
      subsection be refinanced immediately out of the proceeds of the
      first sale by the issuance of debentures under section 726 of
      this title.

    In order to assure that necessary funds are available to the
    Corporation for implementation of the final system plan, the
    Corporation is authorized to accept such loans as may be approved
    by the Association under this subsection, and any such acceptance
    shall be deemed for all purposes to constitute a reasonable and
    prudent business judgment in compliance with any fiduciary
    obligations imposed on the Corporation or its directors. For
    purposes of this subsection, the term "Corporation" includes a
    subsidiary of the Corporation.
    (h) Loans for payment of obligations
      (1)(A) The Association is authorized, subject to the limitations
    set forth in section 720(b) of this title, to enter into loan
    agreements, in amounts not to exceed, at any given time,
    $350,000,000 in the aggregate principal amount, with the
    Corporation, the National Railroad Passenger Corporation, and any
    profitable railroad to which rail properties are transferred or
    conveyed pursuant to section 743(b)(1) of this title, under which
    the Corporation, the National Railroad Passenger Corporation, and
    any profitable railroad entering into such agreement will agree to
    meet existing or prospective obligations of the railroads in
    reorganization in the region which the Association, in accordance
    with procedures established by the Association, determines should
    be paid by the Corporation, the National Railroad Passenger
    Corporation, or a profitable railroad, on behalf of such railroads
    in reorganization, in order to avoid disruptions in ordinary
    business relationships. Such obligations shall be limited to - 
        (i) amounts claimed by suppliers (including private car lines)
      of materials or services utilized or purchased in current rail
      operations;
        (ii) claims by shippers arising from current rail services;
        (iii) payments to railroads for settlement of current interline
      accounts and all other current accounts and obligations;
        (iv) claims of employees arising under the collective-
      bargaining agreements of the railroads in reorganization in the
      region and subject to section 153 of this title (including claims
      for accrued vacation and wages and similar claims arising in
      connection with labor and services performed);
        (v) claims of all employees or their personal representatives
      for personal injuries or death and subject to the provisions of
      Employers' Liability Act (45 U.S.C. 51-60);
        (vi) amounts required for adequate funding of accrued pension
      benefits existing at the time of a conveyance or discontinuance
      of service under employee pension benefit plans described in
      section 775(a) (!2) of this title;

        (vii) amounts required to provide adequate funding for payment,
      when due, of claims deriving from membership in any employee
      voluntary relief plan which provides benefits to its members and
      their beneficiaries in the event of sickness, accident,
      disability, or death, and to which both a railroad in
      reorganization and employee members have made contributions;
        (viii) amounts required to provide adequate funding for
      continuation, by the Corporation, of medical and life insurance

      in reorganization in the region to the National Railroad
      Passenger Corporation, arising out of a contract between such
      railroad in reorganization and such Corporation under which such
      railroad in reorganization is required to provide a suitable rail
      passenger station, in any case in which such railroad in
      reorganization sold a rail passenger station pursuant to a
      judicial order of condemnation prior to April 1, 1976.

      (B) The Association shall make a loan pursuant to subparagraph
    (A) of this paragraph if, notwithstanding any other requirement of
    this subsection, it finds that the Corpration,(!4) the National
    Railroad Passenger Corporation, or a profitable railroad is
    entitled to a loan pursuant to section 743(b)(6), 774(e), or 774(g)
    (!2) of this title, or if, with respect to an obligation referred
    to in subparagraph (A) of this paragraph, it finds that - 

        (i) provision for the payment of such obligation was not
      included in the financial projections of the final system plan;
        (ii) such obligation arose from rail operations prior to the
      date of conveyance of rail properties pursuant to section
      743(b)(1) of this title and is, under other applicable law, the
      responsibility of a railroad in reorganization in the region, and
      a claim is presented to a railroad in reorganization in the
      region, or the Corporation within 2 years after October 19, 1976;
        (iii) the Corporation, the National Railroad Passenger
      Corporation, or a profitable railroad has advised the Association
      that the direct payment of such obligation by the Corporation,
      the National Railroad Passenger Corporation, or a profitable
      railroad is for services or materials, the furnishing of which
      served to avoid disruptions in ordinary business relationships
      prior to the date of conveyance of rail properties pursuant to
      section 743(b)(1) of this title, or is necessary to avoid
      postconveyance disruptions in ordinary business relationships;
        (iv) the transferor is unable to pay such obligation within a
      reasonable period of time; and
        (v) with respect to loans made to the Corporation, the
      procedures to be followed by the Corporation, in seeking
      reimbursement from a railroad in reorganization in the region for
      an obligation paid on its behalf under this subsection, have been
      jointly agreed to by the Finance Committee and the Corporation,
      and the joint agreement - 
          (I) provides for the Corporation to receive reimbursement
        from the Association for any expenses incurred in seeking
        reimbursement from any railroad in reorganization in the region
        for an obligation paid on its behalf under this subsection; and
          (II) includes a stipulation of the exact procedures the
        Corporation shall undertake to avoid the finding, referred to
        in paragraph (6)(A)(i) of this subsection, that it has not
        exercised due diligence.

      (2) The trustees of each railroad in reorganization in the region
    shall attempt to negotiate agency agreements with the Corporation,
    the National Railroad Passenger Corporation, or a profitable
    railroad for the processing of all accounts receivable and accounts
    payable attributable to operations prior to the conveyance of
    property pursuant to section 743(b)(1) of this title and for the
    payment of only those accounts payable which relate to obligations
    of the estates identified in paragraph (1) of this subsection. If
    any railroad in reorganization in the region fails to conclude such
    an agreement within a reasonable time prior to such conveyance, the
    applicable reorganization courts, after giving all parties an
    opportunity to be heard, shall prescribe the terms of such an
    agency arrangement by order, giving due consideration to the need,
    wherever possible, to make such agreements uniform among the
    various estates. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed as
    permitting any district court of the United States having
    jurisdiction over the reorganization of a railroad in
    reorganization in the region to enjoin, restrain, or limit the
    Corporation, the National Railroad Passenger Corporation, or a
    profitable railroad from applying, to payment of the obligations of
    the estates identified in paragraph (1) of this subsection, amounts
    collected as (A) accounts receivable pursuant to this paragraph,
    (B) cash or other current assets identified pursuant to paragraph
    (3) of this subsection, or (C) proceeds of loans pursuant to
    paragraph (1) of this subsection. Any agency agreement executed
    prior to October 19, 1976, shall be deemed amended to the extent
    necessary to conform such agreement or order to the provisions of
    this paragraph. Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to
    affect any payment made prior to October 19, 1976, with respect to
    obligations other than those identified in paragraph (1) of this
    subsection.
      (3) The Association may, not less than 30 days prior to the date
    of conveyance pursuant to section 743(b)(1) of this title, petition
    each district court of the United States having jurisdiction over
    the reorganization of a railroad in reorganization in the region
    for an order, which shall be entered prior to such conveyance, and
    which - 
        (A) identifies that cash and other current assets of the estate
      of such railroad which shall be utilized to satisfy obligations
      of the estates identified in paragraph (1) of this subsection;
      and
        (B) provides for the application by the trustees of such
      railroads and their agents, consistent with the principles of
      reorganization under section 77 of the Bankruptcy Act and with
      the agency agreement specified in paragraph (2) of this
      subsection, of all such current assets, including cash available
      as of or subsequent to such date of conveyance, to the payment in
      the postconveyance period of the obligations of the estates
      identified in paragraph (1) of this subsection.

      (4)(A) Each obligation of a railroad in reorganization in the
    region which is paid with financial assistance under paragraph (1)
    of this subsection shall be processed, on behalf of such railroad,
    by the Corporation, the National Railroad Passenger Corporation, or
    a profitable railroad, whichever is appropriate. An obligation of a
    railroad in reorganization in the region shall be paid, on behalf
    of such railroad, by the Corporation, the National Railroad
    Passenger Corporation, or a profitable railroad, whichever is
    appropriate, if - 
        (i) such obligation is deemed by the Corporation, the National
      Railroad Passenger Corporation, or a profitable railroad,
      whichever is appropriate, to have been, on the date of conveyance
      of rail properties pursuant to section 743(b)(1) of this title,
      the obligation of a railroad in reorganization in the region;
        (ii) such obligation accrues after such date of conveyance but
      as a result of rail operations conducted prior to such date, and
      the trustees of such railroad in reorganization acknowledge that
      it is an obligation of such railroad; or
        (iii) the district court of the United States having
      jurisdiction over such railroad in reorganization in the region
      approves such obligation as a valid administrative claim against
      such railroad;

    to the extent that payment is required under a loan agreement with
    the Association under such paragraph (1).
      (B) The Association shall resolve any disputes among the
    Corporation, the National Railroad Passenger Corporation, and a
    profitable railroad concerning which of them shall process and pay
    any particular obligation on behalf of a particular railroad in
    reorganization.
      (C) The Corporation, the National Railroad Passenger Corporation,
    or a profitable railroad shall have a direct claim, as a current
    expense of administration, for reimbursement from the estate of a
    railroad in reorganization in the region for all obligations of
    such estate (plus interest thereon) which are paid by the
    Corporation, the National Railroad Passenger Corporation, or a
    profitable railroad, as the case may be. The right of the
    Corporation or the National Railroad Passenger Corporation to
    receive reimbursement under this subparagraph from the estate of a
    railroad in reorganization in the region shall be reduced by the
    amount, if any, of loans, plus interest forgiven under paragraph
    (5) of this subsection.
      (D)(i) Except as provided in clause (ii) of this subparagraph,
    any funds held in an escrow account by a railroad in reorganization
    on October 19, 1976, which are thereafter determined to be cash and
    other current assets of the estate of such railroad in
    reorganization, for purposes of paragraph (3) of this subsection,
    shall be applied as follows - 
        (I) first, to the reduction of any outstanding loans to the
      Corporation by the Association, pursuant to paragraph (1) of this
      subsection, the proceeds of which were used to discharge
      obligations of such railroad in reorganization;
        (II) second, to the Association to the extent of any such loans
      which have been forgiven pursuant to paragraph (5) of this
      subsection; and
        (III) third, to the payment of any remaining obligations of
      such railroad in reorganization, in accordance with the provision
      of the agency agreement entered into pursuant to paragraph (2) of
      this subsection.

      (ii) The manner of disposition set forth in clause (i) of this
    subparagraph shall not apply with respect to a railroad in
    reorganization if the Secretary (I) determines that a different
    disposition of assets is necessary to carry out a reorganization
    plan of such railroad in reorganization, and that such different
    disposition adequately protects the interests of the United States,
    and (II) transmits his determination to the court having
    jurisdiction over the reorganization of such railroad.
      (5)(A) If, at any time, the Finance Committee of the Association
    determines that the failure of the Corporation to receive full
    reimbursement with interest from the estate of a railroad in
    reorganization in the region for any obligation of such estate paid
    pursuant to this subsection could adversely affect the fairness and
    equity of the transfers and conveyances pursuant to section
    743(b)(1) of this title, or that the failure of the National
    Railroad Passenger Corporation to receive such full reimbursement
    plus interest for any such obligation would be contrary to the
    public interest, the Association shall forgive the indebtedness,
    plus accrued interest, of the Corporation or of the National
    Railroad Passenger Corporation incurred pursuant to paragraph (1)
    of this subsection in the amount recommended by the Finance
    Committee. The Association shall have a direct claim, as a current
    expense of administration of the estate of such railroad in
    reorganization, equal to the amount by which loans of the
    Corporation or of the National Railroad Passenger Corporation, plus
    interest, have been forgiven. Such direct claim shall not be
    subject to any reduction by way of setoff, cross-claim, or counter-
    claim which the estate of such railroad in reorganization may be
    entitled to assert against the Corporation, the National Railroad
    Passenger Corporation, the Association, or the United States.
      (B) The direct claim of the Association under this paragraph, and
    any direct claim authorized under paragraph (4) of this subsection,
    shall be prior to all other administrative claims of the estate of
    a railroad in reorganization, except claims arising under trustee's
    certificates or from default on the payment of such certificates.
    The Corporation, the National Rail Passenger Corporation, or a
    profitable railroad, as the case may be, shall, with respect to
    each direct claim for reimbursement pursuant to paragraph (4) of
    this subsection, file a proof of administrative expense claim with
    the trustees of the railroad in reorganization from whom
    reimbursement is sought. Each such proof of administrative expense
    claim shall set forth, by category and amount, the obligations of
    such railroad in reorganization which were paid pursuant to such
    paragraph (4).
      (6)(A) Notwithstanding any other provision of this subsection,
    the Association shall forgive any loan made to the Corporation or
    the National Railroad Passenger Corporation pursuant to this
    subsection, plus accrued interest thereon, on the 3rd anniversary
    date of any such loan, except that the Association shall not
    forgive any loan or portion thereof, in accordance with this
    paragraph, if - 
        (i) the Finance Committee makes an affirmative finding, with
      respect to such loan or portion thereof, that - 
          (I) the Corporation has not exercised due diligence in
        executing the procedures adopted pursuant to paragraph
        (1)(B)(v) of this subsection, and
          (II) the failure of the Association to forgive such loan or
        portion thereof will not adversely affect the ability of the
        Corporation to become financially self-sustaining;

        (ii) the Finance Committee so directs the Association; and
        (iii) neither House of the Congress disapproves such
      affirmative finding and direction, in accordance with the
      following provisions of this paragraph.

    A copy of each such finding, the reasons therefor, and such
    direction made by the Finance Committee, together with the comments
    and recommendations thereon of the Board of Directors of the
    Association, shall be transmitted to the Congress by the
    Association within 10 days after the date on which the Finance
    Committee makes such finding and direction, or if not so
    transmitted, shall be transmitted by the Finance Committee. Each
    such finding and direction so transmitted shall become effective
    immediately, and shall remain in effect, unless, within the first
    period of 30 calendar days of continuous session of Congress after
    the date of transmittal of such finding and direction to Congress,
    either House of Congress disapproves such finding and direction in
    accordance with the procedures specified in section 688 of title 2.
    For purposes of this paragraph, continuity of session of Congress
    is broken only in the circumstances described in section 682(5) of
    title 2.
      (B) The Association shall have a direct claim, as a current
    expense of administration of the estate of the railroad in
    reorganization whose obligations were paid with the proceeds of
    loans forgiven under this paragraph, equal to the amount by which
    the loans, plus interest, have been forgiven. Such direct claim
    shall not be subject to any reduction by way of setoff, cross-
    claim, or counterclaim which the estate of such railroad in
    reorganization may be entitled to assert against the Corporation,
    the National Railroad Passenger Corporation, the Association, or
    the United States. The direct claim of the Association under this
    paragraph shall be prior to all other administrative claims of the
    estate of the railroad in reorganization, except claims arising
    under trustee's certificates or from default on the payment of such
    certificates.
      (7) For purposes of this subsection, the term "Corporation"
    includes a subsidiary of the Corporation.

    Corporation under this chapter, the Secretary, with the approval of
    the Association, is authorized to enter into agreements with the
    trustees of the railroads in reorganization in the region (or

        (1) to perform the program maintenance on designated rail
      properties of such railroads until the date rail properties are
      conveyed under this chapter;
        (2) to improve rail properties of such railroads; and
        (3) to acquire rail properties for lease or loan to any such
      railroads until the date such rail properties are conveyed under
      this chapter, and subsequently for conveyance pursuant to the
      final system plan, or to acquire interests in such rail
      properties owned by or leased to any such railroads or in
      purchase money obligations therefor.
    (b) Conditions
      Agreements pursuant to subsection (a) of this section shall
    contain such reasonable terms and conditions as the Secretary may
    prescribe. In addition, agreements under paragraphs (1) and (2) of

      designated for transfer to the Corporation under the final system
      plan, the physical condition of the properties on the effective
      date of the agreement shall be used; and
        (2) in the event that property subject to the agreement is
      sold, leased, or transferred to an entity other than the
      Corporation, the trustees or railroad shall pay or assign to the
      Secretary that portion of the proceeds of such sale, lease, or

    Sec. 726. Debentures and series A preferred stock

-STATUTE-
    (a) General
      The Association is authorized, in accordance with the provisions
    of this section, and such rules and regulations as it may
    prescribe, to invest from time to time in the securities of the
    Corporation by purchasing (1) up to $1,000,000,000 of debentures
    issued by the Corporation, and (2) after the acquisition of such
    debentures, up to $2,629,000,000 of the series A preferred stock of
    the Corporation.
    (b) Purposes and procedure for investment
      (1) The Association is authorized to purchase debentures and,
    thereafter, series A preferred stock of the Corporation at such
    times and in such amounts as may be required and requested by the
    Corporation in accordance with the terms and conditions governing
    such purchases (which shall be prescribed by the Association), to
    provide - 
        (A) for the modernization, rehabilitation and maintenance of
      rail properties of the Corporation;
        (B) for the acquisition of equipment and other capital needs;
        (C) for the refinancing of indebtedness which was incurred by
      the Corporation under section 721 of this title or which was
      incurred under section 725 of this title and assumed by the
      Corporation; or
        (D) working capital as contemplated by the final system plan.

      (2) Purchases of up to $1,000,000,000 of debentures and,
    thereafter, of up to $2,300,000,000 of series A preferred stock
    shall be made by the Association as required and requested by the
    Corporation, unless the Finance Committee makes an affirmative
    finding that - 
        (A) the Corporation has failed in any material respect to
      comply with any covenants or undertakings made to the Association
      and such failure remains uncorrected;
        (B) the Corporation has failed substantially (as determined by
      performance within the margins prescribed by the Board of
      Directors) to attain the overall operating (including
      rehabilitation) and financial results projected for the
      Corporation in the final system plan (including any modifications
      of such projected results and of the performance margins
      applicable to such projected results which are jointly approved
      by the Finance Committee and the Board of Directors and which
      would improve the possibility that the Corporation will attain
      such projected results and perform within such margins, as
      modified); or
        (C) it is not reasonably likely, taking into consideration all
      relevant factors including the overall operating (including
      rehabilitation) and financial results achieved by the
      Corporation, that the Corporation will be able to become
      financially self-sustaining without requiring Federal financial
      assistance substantially in excess of the amounts authorized in
      this section.

      (3)(A) Amounts transferred to the Association pursuant to section
    509(b)(1) (!1) of the Railroad Revitalization and Regulatory Reform
    Act of 1976 may be used to purchase series A preferred stock of the
    Corporation to provide for the implementation by the Corporation of
    a program to reduce the Corporation's work force, if the Finance
    Committee finds that the implementation of such program will result
    in substantial savings to the United States.

      (B) An employee who ceases to be an employee as a result of the
    reduction of work force under a program implemented pursuant to
    this paragraph shall not, by reason of so ceasing to be an
    employee, or by reason of any work or employment entered into after
    so ceasing to be an employee, lose such employee's current
    connection with the railroad industry for the purposes of the
    Railroad Retirement Act of 1974 [45 U.S.C. 231 et seq.].
      (4) Purchases of up to $329,000,000 of a series A preferred stock
    shall be made by the Association, subject to the availability of
    appropriations, as required and requested by the Corporation, if
    the Finance Committee makes an affirmative finding that the
    Corporation has taken appropriate action to eliminate losses on
    light density lines and other lines which are unprofitable. Such
    action shall include the imposition of surcharges on such lines,
    the abandonment of such lines, and the transfer of such lines.
      (5) The authority of the Association to purchase debentures or
    series A preferred stock of the Corporation shall terminate October
    21, 1986.
    (c) Finding, direction, and review by Congress
      (1) If the Finance Committee makes an affirmative finding
    pursuant to subsection (b)(2) of this section, it may direct the
    Association - 
        (A) not to purchase any debentures or series A preferred stock
      of the Corporation after the date of such affirmative finding; or
        (B) to purchase debentures or series A preferred stock of the
      Corporation, after the date of such affirmative finding, only in
      such amounts, at such times, and on such terms and conditions
      (notwithstanding subsection (e)(1) of this section) as the
      Finance Committee determines to be appropriate to the role of the
      Association as an investor in such debentures and series A
      preferred stock.

      (2) A copy of each affirmative finding, the reasons therefor, and
    each direction made by the Finance Committee under paragraph (1) of
    this subsection, together with the comments and recommendations
    thereon of the Board of Directors of the Association, shall be
    transmitted to the Congress by the Association within 10 days after
    the date on which the Finance Committee makes such finding and
    direction, or if not so transmitted, shall be transmitted by the
    Finance Committee. Each such direction so transmitted shall become
    finally effective and is required to be implemented by the
    Association, unless within the first period of 30 calendar days of
    continuous session of Congress after the date of its transmittal to
    Congress either House of Congress disapproves such direction
    (except that such direction shall become finally effective
    immediately upon approval of such direction by both Houses of
    Congress) in accordance with the procedures specified in section
    688 of title 2. For purposes of this paragraph, continuity of
    session of Congress is broken only in the circumstances described
    in section 682(5) of title 2. During review by the Association and
    Congress, the Association shall take no action inconsistent with
    the direction of the Finance Committee pursuant to paragraph (c)(1)
    of this section, except to the extent the Association finds
    necessary, in its discretion, to assure continuous orderly
    operation of the Corporation.
      (3) If the Congress, pursuant to paragraph (2) of this
    subsection, disapproves a direction submitted to the Association
    pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subsection, the Association shall
    continue to purchase the debentures or series A preferred stock of
    the Corporation as otherwise provided in this subchapter until such
    time as a direction is submitted under this section which is not so
    disapproved (or affirmatively approved). The powers of the
    Association and of the Board of Directors of the Association shall
    remain in effect except to the extent modified by any such
    direction. If any such direction is disapproved by either House of
    Congress, the Finance Committee may, not earlier than 30 days after
    the date of such disapproval, make (and the Board of Directors of
    the Association shall transmit) any additional affirmative finding
    and direction with respect to the same matter, which direction
    shall become effective in accordance with paragraph (2) of this
    subsection. An affirmative finding and direction under this
    subsection, or action by the Association during a review thereof by
    the Congress, may not be held unlawful or set aside by any
    reviewing court on the ground that such finding and direction or
    action were not adequate to meet the requirements of subparagraph
    (A), (E), or (F) of section 706(2) of title 5.
      (4) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, or any
    terms and conditions governing its purchase of securities of the
    Corporation, the Association shall, upon written application by the
    Corporation at least 30 days prior to such investment, make an
    initial investment in debentures of the Corporation within 60 days
    after the date of conveyance of rail properties pursuant to section
    743(b)(1) of this title. Such initial investment shall be limited
    to such amounts as the Association and Finance Committee, acting
    jointly, determine are necessary for the continued and orderly
    operations of the Corporation prior to any additional investment.
      (5) Not later than 60 days after the date of conveyance pursuant
    to section 743(b)(1) of this title, the Association shall select 6
    individuals to serve as members of the Board of Directors of the
    Corporation, subject to the provisions of section 741(d) of this
    title.
    (d) Terms and conditions
      Notwithstanding any other provision of State law, the debentures
    and the series A preferred stock of the Corporation shall have such
    terms and conditions, not inconsistent with the final system plan
    or this subchapter, as may be prescribed by the Association, except
    as follows:
        (1) The Corporation shall not be required to issue to the
      Association additional shares of series A preferred stock of the
      Corporation as a dividend on any such stock.
        (2) The dividends payable on series A preferred stock of the
      Corporation shall not be cumulative and shall be paid in cash
      when and to the extent that there is "cash available for
      restricted cash payments", as that term is defined in the final
      system plan.
        (3) After the Association calls for redemption of the
      certificates of value, no shares of series A preferred stock of
      the Corporation shall be issued in lieu of interest on the
      debentures of the Corporation and, to the extent such interest is
      not payable in cash by reason of the absence of sufficient "cash
      available for restricted cash payment", the Corporation shall
      deliver to the holders of the debentures contingent interest
      notes in a face amount equal to such unpaid interest.
        (4) If the Board of Directors of the Association and the
      Finance Committee, acting jointly, modify the terms or conditions
      governing the purchase of debentures or series A preferred stock
      of the Corporation pursuant to subsection (e)(1) of this section,
      or if the Finance Committee waives compliance with any term,
      condition, provision, or covenant of such securities pursuant to
      subsection (e)(2) of this section, the Finance Committee may
      require the Corporation to issue contingent interest notes in
      such amount as, in the determination of the Finance Committee,
      will provide protection for the United States, in the event of
      bankruptcy, reorganization, or receivership of the Corporation,
      equal to the protection the United States would have had in the
      absence of such modification or waiver.
        (5) The contingent interest notes issued pursuant to this
      section shall bear interest compounded annually at the rate of 8
      percent per annum and such notes and the accumulated interest
      thereon shall be payable only in the event of bankruptcy,
      reorganization, or receivership of the Corporation occurring
      prior to the repayment and redemption of all outstanding
      debentures and accumulated series A preferred stock of the
      Corporation. The contingent interest notes and the accumulated
      interest thereon shall have the same priority in bankruptcy,
      reorganization, or receivership as the debentures of the
      Corporation. The other terms and conditions of the contingent
      interest notes shall be as set forth in an agreement to be
      entered into between the Association and the Corporation prior to
      issuance of any debentures.
    (e) Modifications, waivers, and conversions
      (1) The Board of Directors of the Association and the Finance
    Committee, acting jointly, may agree with the Corporation to modify
    any of the terms and conditions governing the purchase by the
    Association of securities of the Corporation, upon a finding that
    such action is necessary or appropriate to achieve the purposes of
    this chapter or the goals of the final system plan.
      (2) The Finance Committee may, in its discretion and upon a
    finding that such action is necessary or appropriate to achieve the
    purposes of this chapter or the goals of the final system plan,
    waive compliance with any term, condition, provision, or covenant
    of the securities of the Corporation held by the Association,
    including any provision of such securities with respect to
    redemption of principal or issuance price, payment of interest or
    dividends, or any term or condition governing the purchase of such
    securities.
      (3) Notwithstanding any provision of State law, there shall be no
    conversion of the debentures of the Corporation into series A
    preferred stock of the Corporation, as provided in the terms and
    conditions of the debentures and pursuant to the final system plan,
    unless the Board of Directors of the Association and the Finance
    Committee jointly determine to effect such conversion.
    (f) Employee stock ownership plan
      (1) The Association shall not invest the final $345,000,000 of
    the additional investment in the Corporation authorized by the
    Regional Rail Reorganization Act Amendments of 1978 unless and
    until (A) the Corporation has in effect an employee stock ownership
    plan which satisfies the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3),
    and (B) the requirements of the other paragraphs of this subsection
    have been satisfied.
      (2) The employee stock ownership plan shall:
        (A) provide:
          (i) for a transfer to the plan and allocation to the accounts
        of plan participants in periodic installments of Series A
        preferred stock of the Corporation with a stated redemption
        value of at least $345,000,000 or any other securities in an
        amount determined by the Association, with the concurrence of
        the Finance Committee, as constituting a meaningful interest in
        the Corporation, or any combination thereof so determined by
        the Association, with the concurrence of the Finance Committee.
        The use of Series A preferred stock to fund the Employee Stock
        Ownership Plan shall not be interpreted to relieve ConRail of
        the responsibility for repaying in full to the United States
        Railway Association its indebtedness as represented by all
        shares originally issued under Public Law 94-210 and this
        chapter;
          (ii) for immediate vesting of the rights of participants to
        such securities upon allocation, subject to defeasance as a
        result of the plan's termination which termination shall occur
        in the event that, by the end of the 120th month beginning
        after the month in which securities or interests therein are
        first allocated to participants' accounts, the Corporation has
        not attained for two consecutive quarters positive net income
        and a freight labor cost to freight revenue ratio equal to the
        average such ratio for all Class I railroads in 1977, as
        determined pursuant to procedures adopted by the Corporation
        pursuant to regulations promulgated by the Association with the
        concurrence of the Finance Committee;

        (B) be an employee benefit plan which is designed to invest
      primarily in employer securities;
        (C) meets such other requirements (similar to requirements
      applicable to employee stock ownership plans as defined in
      section 4975(e)(7) of title 26) as the Secretary of the Treasury
      or his delegate may describe;
        (D) have been approved by the Board of Directors of the
      Corporation to the extent and in the manner which may be required
      by the Corporation's articles of incorporation and bylaws then in
      effect; and
        (E) have been prepared in consultation with, and been approved
      by, the Association and the Finance Committee.

      (3) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, if a plan does
    not meet the requirements of section 401 of title 26 - 
        (A) stock transferred under paragraph (2) and allocated to the
      account of any participant under paragraph (2) shall not be
      considered income of the participant or his beneficiary under
      title 26 until such stock or dividends are actually distributed
      or made available to the participant or his beneficiary and, at
      such time, shall be taxable under section 72 of title 26
      (treating the participant or his beneficiary as having a basis of
      0 in the stock);
        (B) no amount shall be allocated to any participant under the
      plan in excess of the amount which might be allocated if the plan
      met the requirements of section 401 of title 26; and
        (C) the plan must meet the requirements of sections 410 and 415
      of title 26.

      (4) The Corporation shall adopt such terms and conditions
    governing the securities of interests therein to be transferred to
    the plan (including limitations on voting rights) as the
    Association, with the concurrence of the Finance Committee,
    determines are necessary to protect reasonably the interests of the
    United States in the litigation pursuant to section 743(c) of this
    title and in the event of any action to further reorganize or
    restructure the Corporation's assets or capital structure.
      (5) The Corporation, the Association, and a representative
    appointed by the Chairman of the Railway Labor Executives'
    Association as representative of all the classes or crafts of
    employees of the Corporation shall engage in negotiations to agree
    upon a plan in accordance with the provisions of this subsection.
    For purposes of this subsection, the Railway Labor Executives'
    Association shall be deemed to represent all of the representatives
    of crafts or classes of employees of the Corporation and its
    subsidiaries as though that organization held powers of attorney
    from each representative of a craft or class for the limited
    purposes of negotiating and agreeing upon an employee stock
    ownership plan. The parties shall incorporate their agreement into
    a written plan instrument specifying the terms and conditions set
    forth in this subsection and such other terms and conditions as
    they may decide upon, with the concurrence of the Finance
    Committee, unless the parties are unable to reach on (!2) an
    agreement on the plan following the exertion of every reasonable
    effort to do so, in accordance with the Railway Labor Act [45
    U.S.C. 151 et seq.], in which event, the Corporation and the
    Association, with the concurrence of the Finance Committee, shall
    establish a written plan with such terms and conditions as they may
    agree upon in accordance with this subsection. The plan shall not
    be subject to change under the provisions of section 6 of the
    Railway Labor Act [45 U.S.C. 156] until after such time as
    securities have been distributed from the plan to the participants
    in the plan or their beneficiaries pursuant to the terms of the
    plan. Within one year after November 1, 1978, the Corporation shall
    transmit a draft of such plan to the Congress and shall report on
    its progress in establishing and administering the plan. The report
    shall include recommendations of contractual and statutory
    provisions necessary to reasonably (A) exempt any Trustee of the
    plan, the Corporation, the Association, any member of the Finance
    Committee, and any other person from any fiduciary duty,
    responsibility or liability for the acquisition of, investment in,
    or retention of any security or interest therein of the Corporation
    or for any other transaction contemplated by this subsection and
    (B) provide for the United States to indemnify, defend, and hold
    harmless such persons against any and all liabilities, claims,
    actions, judgments, amounts paid in settlement, and costs and
    expenses actually incurred in connection with any matter so
    exempted in which it is determined that such persons were acting in
    good faith and in a manner they believed to not be opposed to the
    best interests of the plan.

      (6) Within fourteen months of November 1, 1978, the Association
    shall report to the Congress on the draft plan and on any legal
    obstacle to the ability of the Corporation to effectuate and
    implement an employee stock ownership plan of the nature
    contemplated by this subsection, including specific recommendations
    on amendments to this subsection and other relevant laws which
    would harmonize the requirements of this subsection with those
    other laws. The Department of Transportation and the Department of
    the Treasury, as each finds appropriate, shall provide separate
    comments to the Association for inclusion with such report.
      (7) For the purposes of this subsection, the officers of each
    duly authorized representative of the crafts or classes of the
    employees of the Corporation who have been given leaves of absence
    by the Corporation to serve as such officers, are to be eligible to
    participate in such plan on the same basis as are employees whose
    employment is governed by a collective bargaining agreement with
    the Corporation.
      (8)(A) Except as provided in subparagraph (B) of this paragraph,
    no person described in subparagraph (C) of this paragraph shall
    have or be subject to any fiduciary responsibility, obligation, or
    duty, nor shall any such person be subject to civil liability,
    under any Federal or State law, as a fiduciary or otherwise - 
        (i) in connection with the employee stock ownership plan and
      related trust established by the Corporation pursuant to the
      requirements of this subsection or with ConRail Equity
      Corporation (I) on account of any reorganization or restructuring
      of the Corporation, its successors or assigns, or their assets or
      capital structure, or (II) on account of any action taken or not
      taken by the Corporation which may affect its ability to attain
      the performance levels established in connection with the plan
      pursuant to paragraph (2)(A)(ii) of this subsection;
        (ii) for or in connection with the establishment, continuation
      or implementation of the plan and related trust or of ConRail
      Equity Corporation or the acquisition of, investment in or
      retention of any security of the Corporation or ConRail Equity
      Corporation, or of any of their successors and assigns, by the
      plan or ConRail Equity Corporation, or the disposition of any
      such security to the extent that such disposition is made in
      connection with a reorganization or restructuring of the
      Corporation, its successors and assigns, or their assets or
      capital structure, as directed or approved by or on behalf of the
      Association or the United States, or the acquisition or retention
      of any cash, security or other property received in connection
      with any such reorganization or restructuring; or
        (iii) for or in connection with any other action taken or not
      taken pursuant to any term or condition of the plan or related
      trust agreement or of the articles of incorporation or bylaws of
      ConRail Equity Corporation.

    Any directions described in clauses (i)(I), (ii), or (iii) shall be
    taken at the direction, or with the consent, of the Association or
    of the Secretary or his designate.
      (B) Subparagraph (A) of this paragraph shall not be interpreted
    to relieve any person from any fiduciary or other responsibility,
    obligation or duty under any Federal or State law to take or not to
    take actions with respect to the plan in connection with (i)
    receiving contributions, (ii) exercising custodial
    responsibilities, (iii) determining eligibility to participate in
    the plan, (iv) calculating, determining and paying benefits, (v)
    processing and deciding claims, (vi) preparing and distributing
    plan information, benefit statements, returns and reports, (vii)
    maintaining plan records, (viii) appointing plan fiduciaries and
    other persons to advise or assist in plan administration and (ix)
    other than as provided in subparagraph (A), acquiring, holding or
    disposing of plan assets.
      (C) For purposes of subparagraph (A) of this paragraph, the term
    "person" includes each of the following:
        (i) the trustee or trustees of the plan, the Corporation and
      its subsidiaries, ConRail Equity Corporation, the Association,
      and any of their successors and assigns;
        (ii) each director, officer, employee and agent of the
      Corporation of (!3) any of its subsidiaries, of ConRail Equity
      Corporation, of the plan, of the Association or of any of their
      successors and assigns; and

        (iii) each member of the Finance Committee and any of their
      employees and agents.

      (D) Neither this paragraph nor paragraph (9) of this subsection
    shall be construed to grant immunity from any criminal law of the
    United States or of any State or the District of Columbia.
      (9) The United States shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless
    the persons described in paragraph (8)(C) of this subsection from
    and against any and all liabilities, claims, actions, judgments,
    amounts paid in settlement, and costs and expenses (including
    reasonable fees of accountants, experts, and attorneys) actually
    incurred in connection with the establishment, implementation, or

    shall be the incorporators of the Corporation and shall take
    whatever steps are necessary to establish the Corporation,
    including the filing of articles of incorporation.
      (2) Notwithstanding any provision of State law, after February 5,
    1976, the members of the executive committee of the Association
    (including duly authorized representatives of members who are
    authorized by this chapter to be represented) and the chief
    executive officer and chief operating officer of the Corporation
    shall adopt the bylaws of the Corporation and serve as the Board of
    Directors of the Corporation until all members of the Board of
    Directors of the Corporation have been selected in accordance with
    subsection (d) of this section. The chief executive officer shall
    serve as chairman of such Board until a chairman thereof is
    selected pursuant to subsection (d) of this section, after which
    time such chairman shall serve at the pleasure of such Board.
    (d) Board of Directors
      (1) Notwithstanding any provision of State law, the articles of
    incorporation and bylaws of the Corporation shall provide that the
    Board of Directors of the Corporation shall consist of 13 members
    selected in accordance with the articles and bylaws of the
    Corporation, as follows:
        (A) six individuals selected by the holders of the
      Corporation's debentures and series A preferred stock voting as
      one class, with every $100 principal amount of debentures, and
      every $100 liquidation amount of series A preferred stock each

    final system plan. Notwithstanding any other provisions of State or
    Federal law, the series B preferred stock and common stock shall

    plan. As a condition of its investment in the Corporation, the
    Association may require that the Corporation adopt limitations

    stock are outstanding. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
    the final system plan, the initial authorized number of shares of
    series B preferred stock may be 35,000,000, and the Corporation may

    on behalf of the holders of the class of securities whose rights
    they exercise pursuant to this subsection.

    or otherwise, to any party by reason of the fact that such person
    is or was a director, if, with respect to the subject matter of the
    action, suit, or proceeding, such person was fulfilling a duty
    which he in good faith reasonably believed to be required by law or
    vested in him in his capacity as a director of the Association or
    as an officer of the United States. The United States shall
    indemnify such person against all judgments, amounts paid in
    settlement, and costs and expenses (including fees of accountants,
    experts, and attorneys), actually and reasonably incurred in
    connection with any such action, suit, or proceeding in which such
    person is determined to have met such standard of conduct. This

    criminal law of the United States.

      The Corporation shall have all of the powers and is subject to
    all of the duties vested in it under this chapter, in addition to
    the powers conferred upon it under the laws of the State or States
    in which it is incorporated and the powers of a railroad in any
    State in which it operates. The Corporation is authorized and
    directed to - 
        (a) acquire rail properties designated in the final system plan
      to be transferred or conveyed to it;

-HEAD-
    Sec. 743. Valuation and conveyance of rail properties

-STATUTE-
    (a) Deposit with court
      Within 10 days after delivery of a certified copy of a final
    system plan pursuant to section 719(c) of this title - 
        (1) the Corporation, in exchange for the rail properties of the
      railroads in reorganization in the region and of railroads
      leased, operated, or controlled by railroads in reorganization in
      the region to be transferred to the Corporation or any subsidiary
      thereof, shall deposit with the special court all of the stock
      and other securities of the Corporation and certificates of value
      issued by the Association designated in the final system plan to
      be exchanged for such rail properties;
        (2) each profitable railroad operating in the region and each
      state or responsible person (including a government entity)
      purchasing rail properties from a railroad in reorganization in
      the region, or from a railroad leased, operated, or controlled by
      a railroad in reorganization in the region, as provided in the
      final system plan shall deposit with the special court the
      compensation to be paid for such rail properties.
    (b) Conveyance of rail properties
      (1) The special court shall, within 10 days after deposit under
    subsection (a) of this section of the securities of the
    Corporation, certificates of value issued by the Association, and
    compensation from the profitable railroads operating in the region,
    States, and responsible persons, order the trustee or trustees of
    each railroad in reorganization in the region to convey forthwith
    to the Corporation or any subsidiary thereof, the respective
    profitable railroads operating in the region, States, and
    responsible persons all right, title, and interest in the rail
    properties of such railroad in reorganization and shall itself
    order the conveyance of all right, title, and interest in the rail
    properties of any person leased, operated, or controlled by such
    railroad in reorganization that are to be conveyed to them under
    the final system plan as certified to such court under section
    719(d) of this title. In any case where the special court orders
    the trustee or trustees of a railroad in reorganization in the
    region to execute and deliver deeds or other instruments conveying
    rail properties to the Corporation or a subsidiary thereof or to a
    profitable railroad operating in the region or a State or
    responsible person, those deeds or other instruments may be
    executed, acknowledged, and delivered on behalf of the trustee or
    trustees by any person or persons who have been duly authorized to
    perform such acts on behalf of the trustee or trustees by the
    district court of the United States or any other court having
    jurisdiction over the respective railroad in reorganization in the
    region. Notwithstanding any provision of State or local law, in any
    case where deeds or other instruments have been executed,
    acknowledged, or delivered by a representative of the trustee or
    trustees of a railroad in reorganization in the region in
    accordance with the previous sentence, such execution,
    acknowledgment, and delivery, and the deeds or other instruments to
    which they pertain, shall have the same legal effect as they would
    have had if the trustee or trustees had themselves executed,
    acknowledged and delivered such deeds or other instruments.
      (2) All rail properties conveyed to the Corporation or any
    subsidiary thereof the respective profitable railroads operating in
    the region, States, and responsible persons under this section
    shall be conveyed free and clear of any liens or encumbrances, but
    subject to such leases and agreements as shall have previously
    burdened such properties or bound the owner or operator thereof in
    pursuance of an arrangement with any State, or local or regional
    transportation authority under which financial support from such
    State, or local or regional transportation authority was being
    provided on January 2, 1974, for the continuance of rail passenger
    service or any lien or encumbrance of no greater than 5 years'
    duration which is necessary for the contractual performance by any
    person of duties related to public health or sanitation. Such
    conveyances shall not be restrained or enjoined by any court.
      (3)(A)(i) Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, if
    an interest in railroad rolling stock is included in the rail
    properties conveyed pursuant to subsection (b)(1) of this section,
    and if such conveyance is in accordance with the requirements of
    clause (ii) of this subparagraph, the conveyance of such properties
    shall be deemed an assignment. Any such assignment shall relieve
    the assignor of liability for any breach which occurs after the
    date of such conveyance, except that such assignor shall remain
    liable for any breach, event of default, or violation of covenant
    which occurred (and any charges or obligations which accrued) prior
    to the date of such conveyance, regardless of whether the assignee
    thereof assumes such liabilities, charges or obligations. If any
    such liabilities, charges, or obligations (accrued prior to the
    date of such conveyance) are paid by or on behalf of any person or
    entity other than such assignor, such person or entity shall have a
    claim to direct reimbursement, as a current expense of
    administration, from such assignor, together with interest on the
    amount so paid.
      (ii) A conveyance referred to in clause (i) of this subparagraph
    may be effected only if - 
        (I) the Corporation or a subsidiary thereof, the profitable
      railroad operating in the region, or the State or responsible
      person to whom such conveyance is made assumes all of the
      obligations under any applicable conditional sale agreement,
      equipment trust agreement, or lease with respect to such rolling
      stock (including any obligations which accrued prior to the date
      on which such properties are conveyed), and
        (II) such conveyance is made subject to such obligations.

    As used in this subparagraph, the term "railroad rolling stock"
    means assets which could be carried in Interstate Commerce
    Commission account numbers 52, 53, 54, and 57.
      (B) Subject to the provisions of this paragraph, the provisions
    of this chapter shall not affect the title and interests of any
    lessor, equipment trust trustee, or conditional sale vendor under
    any conditional sale agreement, equipment trust agreement, or lease
    under section 77(j) of the Bankruptcy Act. A profitable railroad
    operating in the region, the Corporation or a subsidiary thereof,
    or a State or responsible person, to whom such a conveyance is made
    as assignee or as lessee, shall assume all liability under such
    conditional sale agreement, equipment trust agreement, or lease.
    Such an assignment or conveyance to, and such an assumption of
    liability by, such a profitable railroad, Corporation, subsidiary,
    State, or responsible person shall not be deemed a breach, an event
    of default, or a violation of any covenant of any such conditional
    sale agreement, equipment trust agreement, or lease so assigned or
    conveyed, notwithstanding any provisions of any such agreement or
    lease.
      (4) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
    chapter, if a railroad in reorganization has leased rail properties
    from a lessor that is neither a railroad nor controlled by or
    affiliated with a railroad, and such lease has been approved by the
    lessee railroad's reorganization court prior to January 2, 1974,
    conveyance of such lease may only be effected if the Corporation,
    profitable railroad, State, or responsible person to whom the
    conveyance is made assumes all future liability under such lease
    and all of the terms and conditions specified in the lease,
    including the obligation to pay the specified rent to the non-
    railroad lessor.
      (5) Notwithstanding any covenant, undertaking, condition, or
    provision of any sort in any lease, agreement, or contract, the
    conveyance, transfer, assignment, or other disposition of such
    lease, agreement, or contract or of any interest therein to, or the
    assumption by, the Corporation or any subsidiary thereof, or a
    profitable railroad of obligations thereunder, shall not be deemed
    a breach, an event of default, or a violation of any covenant of
    such lease, agreement, or contract.
      (6)(A) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
    chapter or any other other (!1) provision of law, the special court
    shall include in its order such further directions as may be
    necessary to assure (i) that the operation and administration of
    the employee pension benefit plans described in section 775(a) (!2)
    of this title shall be continued, without termination or
    interruption, by the Corporation until such time as the Corporation
    elects to amend or terminate any such plan, in whole or in part;
    and (ii) that appropriate transfers and assignments with respect to
    all rights and obligations relating to such plans shall be made to
    the Corporation for such purposes, without prejudice to payment of
    consideration for whatever rights any railroad in reorganization
    may have in any residual assets under any such employee pension
    benefit plan. No court shall enter any judgment against the
    Corporation with respect to any such rights, except that the
    special court may enter such a judgment in an order issued by it
    pursuant to subsection (c) of this section, after taking into
    consideration the rights and obligations transferred pursuant to
    this paragraph. All liabilities as an employer shall be imposed
    solely upon the railroad in reorganization in the event such plan
    is terminated, in whole or in part, by the Corporation within 1
    year after the date of such transfer or assignment (except
    liabilities as an employer under the Employee Retirement Income
    Security Act of 1974 [29 U.S.C. 1001 et seq.] for benefits accruing
    during such period), except that in any case in which the
    Corporation, on or after the date of transfer or assignment as
    provided by this paragraph, terminates in whole or in part any such
    plan, the benefits under which are not guaranteed under title IV of
    the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 [29 U.S.C. 1301
    et seq.], the Corporation shall guarantee the payment when due of
    the accrued pension benefits provided for thereunder at the time of
    termination. The Corporation shall be entitled to a loan pursuant
    to section 721(h) of this title in an amount required for the
    adequate funding of accrued pension benefits under all plans
    transferred or assigned to the Corporation in accordance with this
    paragraph (whether or not terminated by the Corporation). For
    purposes of such section 721(h) and notwithstanding any other
    provision of Federal or State law, amounts required for such
    adequate funding shall be deemed to be expenses of administration
    of the respective estates of the railroads in reorganization, due
    and payable as of the date of transfer or assignment of the plans
    to the Corporation.


      (B) The Corporation shall, through the purchase of insurance or
    otherwise, maintain in effect any medical insurance coverage or so
    much of any life insurance coverage that does not exceed in death
    benefits an amount equal to twice the employee's annual salary at
    the time of retirement or $60,000, whichever is lower, which
    coverage was maintained by a railroad in reorganization in the
    region immediately prior to April 1, 1976, and which provides
    insurance benefits to employees who retired, prior to April 1,
    1976, from service with such a railroad. With respect to any such
    employee whose medical or life insurance coverage lapsed after
    April 1, 1976, due to nonpayment of premiums, the Corporation shall
    - 
        (i) through the purchase of insurance or otherwise, provide
      medical insurance benefits or life insurance benefits at the same
      level as were provided by the employer railroad in reorganization
      and in effect with respect to such employees immediately prior to
      April 1, 1976, except that the life insurance benefits so
      provided shall not exceed in death benefits an amount equal to
      twice the employee's annual salary at the time of retirement or
      $60,000, whichever is lower; and
        (ii) assume and pay any claim for such employee (or his
      personal representative) for any such insurance benefits, if - 
          (I) such claim arose during the period beginning April 1,
        1976, and ending on the date insurance coverage is provided
        pursuant to clause (i) of this subparagraph;
          (II) such benefits were not paid by an insurer solely because
        of the lapse of the insurance coverage during such period,

      except that such death benefits shall not be paid for any such
      employee in excess of an amount equal to twice the employee's
      annual salary at the time of retirement or $60,000, whichever is
      lower.

    The Corporation shall be entitled to a loan pursuant to section
    721(h) of this title in an amount required for the payment of
    insurance premiums and benefits described in this subparagraph. For
    purposes of section 721(h)(4)(A)(iii) of this title, amounts
    required for the payment of such premiums and benefits shall be
    deemed to be valid administrative claims against the respective
    estates of the railroads in reorganization, due and payable as of
    April 1, 1976, or, in the case of a railroad in reorganization
    which is not subject to a bankruptcy proceeding, such amounts shall
    be deemed to be obligations of such railroad, due and payable as of
    such date, and shall be reimbursable in accordance with the
    procedures set forth in paragraphs (4) and (5) of such section
    721(h) of this title. As used in this subparagraph, the term
    "railroad in reorganization" includes any railroad which is
    controlled by a railroad in reorganization but is not itself
    subject to a bankruptcy proceeding, if such railroad conveyed
    substantially all of its rail properties to the Corporation
    pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subsection and conducted
    operations over such rail properties prior to the date of such
    conveyance.
    (c) Findings and distribution
      (1) After the rail properties have been conveyed to the
    Corporation or any subsidiary thereof, profitable railroads
    operating in the region, States, and responsible persons under
    subsection (b) of this section, the special court, giving due
    consideration to the findings contained in the final system plan,
    shall decide - 
        (A) whether the transfers or conveyances - 
          (i) of rail properties of each railroad in reorganization, or
        of each railroad leased, operated, or controlled by a railroad
        in reorganization, to the Corporation or any subsidiary thereof
        in exchange for the certificates of value and the other
        benefits accruing to such railroad as a result of such exchange
        (taking into consideration compensable unconstitutional
        erosion, if any, which the special court finds to have occurred
        in the estate of each such railroad, during the bankruptcy
        proceeding with respect to such railroad) as provided in the
        final system plan and this chapter, and
          (ii) of rail properties of each railroad in reorganization,
        or of each railroad leased, operated, or controlled by a
        railroad in reorganization, to a profitable railroad operating
        in the region in exchange for compensation and other benefits
        accruing to such transferor as a result of such exchange
        (taking into consideration compensable unconstitutional
        erosion, if any, which the special court finds to have occurred
        in the estate of each such railroad, during the bankruptcy
        proceeding with respect to such railroad) State, or responsible
        person in accordance with the final system plan,

      are in the public interest and are fair and equitable to the
      estate of each railroad in reorganization in accordance with the
      standard of fairness and equity applicable to the approval of a
      plan of reorganization or a step in such a plan under section 77
      of the Bankruptcy Act, or fair and equitable to a railroad that
      is not itself in reorganization but which is leased, operated, or
      controlled by a railroad in reorganization;
        (B) whether the transfers or conveyances are more fair and
      equitable than is required as a constitutional minimum; and
        (C) what portion of the proceeds received by a railroad in
      reorganization from an entity other than the Corporation or any
      subsidiary thereof for the sale, lease, or transfer of property
      subject to an agreement under section 723 or section 725(a)(1) or
      (2) of this title reflects value attributable to the maintenance
      or improvement provided pursuant to the agreement.

      (2) If the special court finds that the terms of one or more
    exchanges for certificates of value and other benefits are not fair
    and equitable to an estate of a railroad in reorganization, or to a
    railroad leased, operated, or controlled by a railroad in
    reorganization (taking into consideration compensable
    unconstitutional erosion, if any, which the special court finds to
    have occurred in the estate of each such railroad, during the
    bankruptcy proceeding with respect to such railroad), which has
    transferred rail properties pursuant to the final system plan, it
    may - 
        (A) enter a judgment reallocating the certificates of value in
      a fair and equitable manner if they have not been fairly
      allocated among the railroads transferring rail properties to the
      Corporation or any subsidiary thereof, except that one
      certificate of value shall be allocated to each such railroad;
      and
        (B) if the lack of fairness and equity cannot be completely
      cured by a reallocation of the certificates of value, order the
      Corporation to provide for the transfer to the railroad of
      certificates of value issued by the Association as designated in
      the final system plan in such nature and amount as would make the
      exchange or exchanges fair and equitable; and
        (C) enter a judgment against the Corporation if the judgment
      would not endanger the viability or solvency of the Corporation.

      (3) If the special court finds that the terms of one or more
    conveyances of rail properties to a profitable railroad operating
    in the region, State, or responsible person in accordance with the
    final system plan are not fair and equitable, it shall enter a
    judgment against such profitable railroad, State, or responsible
    person. If the special court finds that the terms of one or more
    conveyances or exchanges for certificates of value or other
    benefits are fairer and more equitable than is required as a
    constitutional minimum, then it shall order the return of any
    excess certificates of value, or compensation to the Corporation or
    a profitable railroad, State, or responsible person so as not to
    exceed the constitutional minimum standard of fairness and equity.
    The special court shall also find the amount of the payments, if
    any, which each profitable railroad has made on behalf of a
    transferor railroad in reorganization in accordance with section
    721(h) of this title, for which payment the profitable railroad has
    not been reimbursed, as provided in section 721(h) of this title.
    Notwithstanding any other provision of this paragraph or of
    paragraph (4), the special court shall order the return to any such
    profitable railroad from compensation deposited by such profitable
    railroad pursuant to subsection (a)(2) of this section, of any such
    amount so found together with interest at the rate provided in
    section 721(h) of this title. In making any finding under this
    paragraph, the special court shall take into consideration
    compensable unconstitutional erosion, if any, which it finds to
    have occurred in the estate of a railroad in reorganization in the
    region, or of a railroad leased, operated, or controlled by such a
    railroad, during the bankruptcy proceeding with respect to such
    railroad.
      (4) Upon making the findings referred to in this subsection, the
    special court shall order distribution of the certificates of value
    and compensation deposited with it under subsection (a) of this
    section to the trustee or trustees of each railroad in
    reorganization in the region and to persons leased, operated, or
    controlled by such railroads who so transferred or conveyed rail
    properties who conveyed right, title, and interest in rail
    properties to the Corporation and the respective profitable
    railroads, States, and responsible persons under such subsection.
      (5) Whenever the special court, pursuant to subsection (b)(1) of
    this section, orders the transfer or conveyance of rail properties -
     
        (A) designated under section 716(c)(1)(C) or (D) of this title,
      to the Corporation or any subsidiary thereof, the United States
      shall indemnify the Corporation against any costs or liabilities
      imposed on the Corporation as the result of any judgment entered
      against the Corporation, with respect to such properties, under
      paragraph (2) of this subsection; and
        (B) to the National Railroad Passenger Corporation, a
      profitable railroad operating in the region, a State, or any
      other responsible person (including a governmental entity), the
      United States shall indemnify such Corporation, railroad, State,
      or person against any costs or liabilities imposed thereon as the
      result of any judgment entered against such Corporation,
      railroad, State, or person under paragraph (3) of this
      subsection;

    plus interest on the amount of such judgment at such rate as is
    constitutionally required. The United States may, in its
    discretion, represent the Corporation or the National Railroad
    Passenger Corporation, such profitable railroad, State or
    responsible person, in any proceedings before the special court
    that could result in such a judgment against the Corporation under
    paragraph (2) of this subsection or against the National Railroad
    Passenger Corporation, such profitable railroad, State or
    responsible person, under paragraph (3) of this subsection. The
    Corporation, the National Railroad Passenger Corporation, any
    profitable railroad, State, or responsible person, which is
    represented by the United States of America shall cooperate
    diligently in whatever manner the United States shall reasonably
    request of it in connection with such proceedings. Neither the
    Corporation, or its subsidiaries, nor the National Railroad
    Passenger Corporation, any profitable railroad, State or
    responsible person, shall be obligated to reimburse the United
    States for any moneys paid by the United States pursuant to this
    section.
      (6) Whenever the Corporation exercises an option to acquire, or
    acquires, interests in rail marine freight floating equipment
    pursuant to the recommendations of the final system plan, and the
    Corporation thereafter makes such floating equipment available to a
    profitable railroad operating in the region, a State, or a
    responsible person including (!3) a government entity), the United
    States shall indemnify - 

        (A) the Corporation against any costs or liabilities imposed on
      the Corporation as the result of any judgment entered against it,
      with respect to such equipment, under paragraph (2) of this
      subsection; and
        (B) such profitable railroad, State, or responsible person
      against any costs or liabilities imposed thereon as the result of
      any judgment entered against such profitable railroads, State, or
      responsible person under paragraph (3) of this subsection,

    plus interest on the amount of such judgment at such rate as is
    constitutionally required.
    (d) Appeal

        (B) not sooner than 30 days following the effective date of the
      final system plan, the trustee or trustees of the applicable
      railroad in reorganization or a profitable railroad give notice
      in writing of intent to discontinue such service on a date
      certain which is not less than 60 days after the date of such
      notice or on the date of any conveyance ordered by the special
      court pursuant to section 743(b)(1) of this title, whichever is
      later; and
        (C) the notice required by subparagraph (B) of this paragraph
      is sent by certified mail to the Commission; to the chief
      executive officer, the transportation agencies, and the
      government of each political subdivision of each State in which
      such rail properties are located; and to each shipper who has
      used such rail service during the previous 12 months.

      (2)(A) If rail properties are not, in accordance with the
    designations in the final system plan, required to be operated, as
    a consequence of a recommended arrangement for joint use or
    operation of rail properties (under section 716(g) of this title)
    or as part of a coordination project (under sections 716(c) and (g)
    of this title), rail service on such properties may be
    discontinued, subsequent to the date of conveyance of rail
    properties pursuant to such section 743(b)(1) of this title, if the
    Commission determines that such rail service on such rail
    properties is not compensatory and if - 
        (i) the petitioner and any other railroad involved in such
      arrangement or coordination project have, prior to filing an
      application for such discontinuance, entered into a binding
      agreement (effective on or before the effective date of such
      discontinuance) to carry out such arrangement or project;
        (ii) such application is filed with the Commission not later
      than 1 year after the effective date of the final system plan;
      and
        (iii) such discontinuance is not precluded by the terms of the
      leases and agreements referred to in such section 743(b)(2).

      (B) For purposes of this paragraph, rail service on rail
    properties is compensatory if the revenue attributable to such
    properties from such service equals or exceeds the sum of the
    avoidable costs of providing such service on such properties plus a
    reasonable return on the value of such rail properties, as
    determined in accordance with the standards developed pursuant to
    section 10362(b)(6) (!1) of title 49.

      (C) The Commission shall make its final determination, with
    respect to any discontinuance requested under this paragraph, not
    later than 120 days after the date of filing of an application
    therefor. The applicant shall have the burden of proving that the
    service involved is not compensatory. If the Commission fails to
    make a final determination within such time, the application shall
    be deemed to be granted.
      (D) The Commission may issue such rules, regulations, and
    procedures as it deems necessary for the conduct of its functions
    under this paragraph.
    (b) Abandonment
      (1) Except as provided in subsections (c) and (f) of this
    section, rail properties over which rail service has been
    discontinued under subsection (a) of this section may not be
    abandoned sooner than 120 days after the effective date of the
    discontinuance. Thereafter, except as provided in subsection (c) of
    this section, such rail properties may be abandoned upon 30 days'
    notice in writing to any person (including a government entity)
    required to receive notice under subsection (a)(1)(C) of this
    section.
      (2) In any case in which rail properties proposed to be abandoned
    under this section are designated by the final system plan as rail
    properties which are suitable for use for other public purposes
    (including roads or highways, other forms of mass transportation,
    conservation, and recreation), such rail properties shall not be
    sold, leased, exchanged, or otherwise disposed of during the 240-
    day period beginning on the date of notice of proposed abandonment
    under this section unless such rail properties have first been
    offered, upon reasonable terms, for acquisition for public
    purposes.
      (3) Rail service may be discontinued, under subsection (a) of
    this section, and rail properties may be abandoned, under this
    section, notwithstanding any provision of part A of subtitle IV of
    title 49, the constitution or law of any State, or the decision of
    any court or administrative agency of the United States or of any
    State.
    (c) Continuation of rail services
      No rail service may be discontinued and no rail properties may be
    abandoned, pursuant to this section - 
        (1) in the case of service and properties referred to in
      subsections (a)(1) and (b)(1) of this section, after 2 years from
      the effective date of the final system plan or more than 2 years
      after the date on which the final rail service continuation
      payment is received, whichever is later; or
        (2) if a financially responsible person (including a government
      entity) offers - 
          (A) to provide a rail service continuation payment which is
        designed to cover the difference between the revenue
        attributable to such rail properties and the avoidable costs of
        providing rail service on such properties, together with a
        reasonable return on the value of such properties;
          (B) to provide a rail service continuation payment which is
        payable pursuant to a lease or agreement with a State or with a
        local or regional transportation authority under which
        financial support was being provided on January 2, 1974 for the
        continuation of rail passenger service; or
          (C) to purchase, pursuant to subsection (f) of this section,
        such rail properties in order to operate rail services thereon.

    If a rail service continuation payment is offered, pursuant to
    paragraph (2)(A) of this subsection, for both freight and passenger
    service on the same rail properties, the owner of such properties
    may not be entitled to more than one payment of a reasonable return
    on the value of such properties.
    (d) Rail freight service
      (1) If a rail service continuation payment is offered, pursuant
    to subsection (c)(2)(A) of this section, for rail freight service,
    the person offering such payment shall designate the operator of
    such service and enter into an operating agreement with such
    operator. The person offering such payment shall designate as the
    operator of such service - 
        (A) the Corporation, if rail properties of the Corporation
      connect with the line of railroad involved, unless the Commission
      determines that such rail service continuation could be performed
      more efficiently and economically by another railroad;
        (B) any other railroad whose rail properties connect with such
      line, if the Corporation's rail properties do not so connect or
      if the Commission makes a determination in accordance with
      subparagraph (A) of this paragraph; or
        (C) any responsible person (including a government entity)
      which is willing to operate rail service over such rail
      properties.

    A designated railroad may refuse to enter into such an operating
    agreement only if the Commission determines, on petition by any
    affected party, that the agreement would substantially impair such
    railroad's ability to serve adequately its own patrons or to meet
    its outstanding common carrier obligations. The designated operator
    shall, pursuant to each such operating agreement (i) be obligated
    to operate rail freight service on such rail properties, and (ii)
    be entitled to receive, from the person offering such payment, the
    difference between the revenue attributable to such properties and
    the avoidable costs of providing service on such rail properties,
    together with a reasonable management fee, as determined by the
    Office.
      (2) The trustees of a railroad in reorganization shall permit
    rail service to be continued on any rail properties with respect to
    which a rail service continuation payment operating agreement has
    been entered into under this subsection. Such trustees shall
    receive a reasonable return on the value of such properties, as
    determined in accordance with the standards developed pursuant to
    section 10362(b)(6) (!1) of title 49.
      (3) If necessary to prevent any disruption or loss of rail
    service, at any time after the date of conveyance, pursuant to
    section 743(b)(1) of this title, the Commission shall take such
    action as may be appropriate under its existing authority
    (including the enforcement of common carrier requirements
    applicable to railroads in reorganization in the region) to ensure
    compliance with obligations imposed under this subsection. The
    district courts of the United States shall have jurisdiction, upon
    petition by the Commission or any interested person (including a
    government entity), to enforce any order of the Commission issued
    pursuant to the exercise of its authority under this subsection, or
    to enjoin any designated entity or the trustees of a railroad in
    reorganization in the region from refusing to comply with the
    provisions of this subsection.
      (4) No determination of reasonable payment for the use of rail
    properties of a railroad in reorganization in the region, and no
    determination of value of rail properties of such a railroad
    (including supporting or related documents or reports of any kind)
    which is made in connection with any lease agreement, contract of
    sale, or other agreement or understanding which is entered into
    after October 19, 1976 - 
        (A) pursuant to this section; or
        (B) pursuant to section 762 (!1) of this title or section 17
      (!1) of the Federal Transit Act (49 U.S.C. 1613),

    shall be admitted as evidence, or used for any other purpose, in
    any civil action, or any other proceeding for damages or
    compensation, arising under this chapter.
    (e) Rail passenger service
      (1) The Corporation (or a profitable railroad) shall provide rail
    passenger service for a period of 180 days immediately following
    the date of conveyance (pursuant to section 743(b)(1) of this
    title), with respect to any rail properties over which a railroad
    in reorganization in the region, or a person leased, operated, or
    controlled by such a railroad, was providing rail passenger service
    immediately prior to such date of conveyance. Such service shall be
    provided on such properties regardless of whether or not such
    properties are designated in the final system plan as rail
    properties over which rail service is required to be operated,
    except with respect to properties over which such service is
    provided by the National Railroad Passenger Corporation.
      (2) If a State (or a local or regional transportation authority)
    was providing financial assistance to support the operation of rail
    passenger service, pursuant to a lease or agreement which was in
    effect immediately prior to the date of conveyance (pursuant to
    such section 743(b)(1) of this title), the Corporation (or a
    profitable railroad) shall be bound by the service provisions of
    such lease or agreement for the duration of the 180-day mandatory
    operation period specified in paragraph (1) of this subsection. If
    a State or such an authority was providing financial assistance for
    the continuation of rail passenger service on rail properties
    immediately prior to such date of conveyance, it shall provide the
    same level of financial assistance during such 180-day mandatory
    operation period. If no such financial assistance was being
    provided or if no such lease or agreement was in effect immediately
    prior to such date of conveyance, with respect to any such rail
    properties, the Corporation (or a profitable railroad) shall
    provide the same level of rail passenger service, for the duration
    of such 180-day mandatory operation period, that was provided prior
    to such date by the applicable railroad. If - 
        (A) such financial assistance is not provided;
        (B) a State (or a local or regional transportation authority)
      has not, by the end of such 180-day mandatory operation period,
      offered a rail service continuation payment pursuant to
      subsection (c)(2)(A) of this section;
        (C) an applicable rail service continuation payment pursuant to
      such subsection (c)(2)(A) of this section is not paid when it is
      due; or
        (D) a payment required under a lease or agreement, pursuant to
      section 743(b)(2) of this title or subsection (c)(2)(B) of this
      section, is not paid when it is due,

    the Corporation (or, where applicable, the National Railroad
    Passenger Corporation, a profitable railroad, or the trustee or
    trustees of a railroad in reorganization in the region) may (i)
    discontinue such rail passenger service, and (ii) with respect to
    rail properties not designated for inclusion in the final system
    plan, abandon such properties pursuant to subsections (a) and (b)
    of this section.
      (3) Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to affect the
    obligation of the Corporation (or a profitable railroad), or of the
    trustees of the railroads in reorganization in the region, to
    provide rail passenger service pursuant to section 743(b)(2) of
    this title or subsection (c)(2)(B) of this section.
      (4) If a State (or a local or regional transportation authority) -
     
        (A) offers a rail service continuation payment, pursuant to
      subsection (c)(2)(A) of the (!2) section, for the operation of
      rail passenger service after the 180-day mandatory operation
      period, and

        (B) provides compensation, pursuant to paragraph (2) of this
      subsection, for operations conducted during the 180-day mandatory
      operation period; or
        (C) offers a rail service continuation payment, pursuant to
      subsection (c)(2)(A) of this section, for the operation of rail
      passenger service provided under an agreement or lease pursuant
      to section 743(b)(2) of this title or subsection (c)(2)(B) of
      this section where such offer is made for the continuation of the
      service beyond the period required by such agreement or lease,
      except that such services shall not be eligible for assistance
      under section 17(a)(2) (!3) of the Federal Transit Act (49 U.S.C.
      1613(a)(2)),


    the Corporation (or a profitable railroad) shall continue to
    provide such service after the end of such period, except as
    otherwise provided in this subsection.
      (5)(A) The Secretary shall reimburse the Corporation (or a
    profitable railroad) for any loss which is incurred by it during
    the 180-day mandatory operation period specified in paragraph (1)
    of this subsection which is not compensated for by a State (or a
    local or regional transportation authority). The amount of such
    reimbursement shall be determined pursuant to section 17(a)(1) (!3)
    of the Federal Transit Act.
      (B) The Secretary shall reimburse States, local public bodies,
    and agencies thereof for additional costs incurred by such States,
    bodies, and agencies for rail service continuation payments for
    rail passenger service pursuant to section 17(a)(2) (!3) of the
    Federal Transit Act.
      (C) For purposes of the obligation of the Secretary to reimburse
    the Corporation (or a profitable railroad) or States, local public
    bodies, and agencies thereof under subparagraphs (A) and (B) of
    this paragraph, the level of rail passenger service shall be
    determined on the basis of train miles, car miles, or some other
    appropriate indicia of scheduled train movements. Programs to
    correct deferred maintenance on rolling stock, right-of-way, and
    other facilities which are designed to maintain service, meet on-
    time performance, and maintain a reasonable degree of passenger
    comfort (and costs incurred incident thereto) shall be included
    within the meaning of the term "loss" as used in subparagraph (A)
    of this paragraph and within the meaning of the term "additional
    costs" as used in subparagraph (B) of this paragraph and section
    17(a)(2) (!3) of the Federal Transit Act (49 U.S.C. 1613(a)(2)).
      (D) If a dispute arises with respect to the application of any
    such regulations, the parties to such dispute may submit such
    dispute to arbitration by a third party. If the parties are unable
    to agree upon the selection of an arbitrator, the Chairman of the
    Commission shall serve in that capacity (except as to matters
    required to be decided by the Commission, pursuant to section
    562(a) of this title).
      (6) Notwithstanding any other provision of this subsection, the
    Corporation is not obligated to provide rail passenger service on
    rail properties if a State (or a local or regional transportation
    authority) contracts for such service to be provided on such
    properties by an operator other than the Corporation, except that
    the Corporation shall, where appropriate, provide such operator
    with access to such properties for such purpose.
      (7)(A) If a State (or a local or regional transportation
    authority) in the region offers to provide payment for the
    provision of additional rail passenger service, the Corporation
    shall undertake to provide such service pursuant to this subsection
    (including the discontinuance provisions of paragraph (2) of this
    subsection). An offer to provide payment for the provision of
    additional rail passenger service shall be made in accordance with
    subsection (c)(2)(A) of this section, and shall be designed to
    avoid any additional costs to the Corporation arising from the
    construction or modification of capital facilities or from any
    additional operating delays or costs arising from the absence of
    such construction or modification. The State (or local or regional
    transportation authority) shall demonstrate that it has acquired,
    leased, or otherwise obtained access to all rail properties, other
    than those designated for conveyance to the National Railroad
    Passenger Corporation pursuant to sections 716(c)(1)(C) and
    716(c)(1)(D) of this title and to the Corporation pursuant to
    section 743(b)(1) of this title, necessary to provide the
    additional rail passenger service and that it has completed, or
    will complete prior to the inception of the additional rail
    service, all capital improvements necessary to avoid significant
    costs which cannot be avoided by improved scheduling or other means
    on other existing rail services (including rail freight service)
    and to assure that the additional service will not detract from the
    level and quality of existing rail passenger and freight service.
      (B) As used in this paragraph, the term "additional rail
    passenger service" means rail passenger service (other than rail
    passenger service provided pursuant to the provisions of paragraphs
    (2) and (4) of this subsection), including extended or expanded
    service and modified routings, which is to be provided over rail
    properties conveyed to the Corporation pursuant to section
    743(b)(1) of this title, or over (i) rail properties contiguous
    thereto conveyed to the National Railroad Passenger Corporation
    pursuant to this chapter, or (ii) any other rail properties
    contiguous thereto to which a State (or local or regional
    transportation authority) has obtained access.
      (C) Notwithstanding any other provision of this paragraph, the
    Corporation shall not be required to operate additional rail
    passenger service over rail properties leased or acquired from or
    owned or leased by a profitable railroad in the region.
      (8) The Secretary shall, in consultation with the Association,
    conduct a study to determine the best means of compensating the
    Corporation for liabilities which it may incur for damages to
    persons or property, resulting from the operation of rail passenger
    service required to be operated pursuant to this subsection or
    section 743(b)(2) of this title, which are not underwritten by
    private insurance carriers or are not indemnified by a State (or
    local or regional transportation authority). Such study shall
    identify the nature of the risks to the Corporation, the probable
    degree of uninsurability of such risks, and the desirability and
    feasibility of various indemnification programs, including subsidy
    offers made pursuant to this section, self-insurance through a
    passenger tax or other mechanism, or government indemnification for
    such liabilities. Within one year after November 8, 1978, the
    Secretary shall prepare a report with appropriate recommendations
    and shall submit such report to the Congress. Such report shall
    specify the most appropriate means of indemnifying the Corporation
    for such liabilities in a manner which shall prevent the cross-
    subsidization of passenger services with revenues from freight
    services operated by the Corporation.
    (f) Purchase
      If an offer to purchase is made under subsection (c)(2)(C) of
    this section, such offer shall be accompanied by an offer of a rail
    service continuation payment. Such payment shall continue until the
    purchase transaction is completed, unless a railroad assumes
    operations over such rail properties of its own account pursuant to
    an order or authorization of the Commission. Whenever a railroad in
    reorganization in the region or a profitable railroad gives notice
    of intent to discontinue service pursuant to subsection (a) of this
    section, such railroad shall, upon the request of anyone apparently
    qualified to make an offer to purchase or to provide a rail service
    continuation payment, promptly make available its most recent
    reports on the physical condition of such property, together with
    such traffic and revenue data as would be required under subpart B
    of part 1121 of chapter X of title 49 of the Code of Federal
    Regulations and such other data as are necessary to ascertain the
    avoidable costs of providing service over such rail properties.
    (g) Abandonment by Corporation
      After the rail system to be operated by the Corporation or a
    subsidiary thereof under the final system plan has been in
    operation for 2 years, the Commission may authorize the Corporation
    or a subsidiary thereof to abandon any rail properties as to which
    it determines that rail service over such properties is not
    required by the public convenience and necessity, if the
    Corporation or a subsidiary thereof can demonstrate that no State
    (or local or regional transportation authority) is willing to offer
    a rail service continuation payment pursuant to subsection (c) of
    this section. The Commission may, at any time after the effective
    date of the final system plan, authorize additional rail service in
    the region or authorize the abandonment of rail properties which
    are not being operated by the Corporation or any subsidiary or
    affiliate thereof or by any other person. Determinations by the
    Commission under this subsection shall be made pursuant to
    applicable provisions of part A of subtitle IV of title 49.
    (h) Interim abandonment
      After February 5, 1976, and prior to the date of conveyance
    (pursuant to section 743(b)(1) of this title), no railroad in
    reorganization in the region may discontinue service or abandon any
    line of railroad other than in accordance with the provisions of
    this chapter, unless (1) it is authorized to do so by the
    Association, and (2) no affected State (or local or regional
    transportation authority) reasonably opposes such action,
    notwithstanding any provision of any other Federal law, the
    constitution or law of any State, or the decision or order of, or
    the pendency of any proceeding before any Federal or State court,
    agency, or authority.
    (i) Disposition of designated rail properties
      No railroad in reorganization in the region and no person leased,
    operated or controlled by such a railroad shall sell, transfer,
    encumber, or otherwise dispose of rail property, or any right or
    interest therein, designated for transfer to the Corporation or
    conveyance to a profitable railroad in the final system plan,
    except pursuant to section 743(b) of this title. The provisions of
    this subsection shall not apply to any such sale, transfer,
    encumbrance, or other disposition - 
        (1) as to which the Association generally or specifically
      consents in writing;
        (2) which, prior to February 5, 1976, had been specifically
      approved by a United States district court having jurisdiction
      over the reorganization of a railroad in reorganization under
      section 77 of the Bankruptcy Act; or
        (3) following certification to the special court, pursuant to
      section 719(c) of this title, of any such rail properties not
      previously so certified.

    CHAPTER 16 - REGIONAL RAIL REORGANIZATION
    SUBCHAPTER III - CONSOLIDATED RAIL CORPORATION

-HEAD-
    Sec. 745. Continuing reorganization; supplemental transactions

-STATUTE-
    (a) Proposals
      If the Secretary or the Association determines that, as part of
    continuing reorganization, further restructuring of rail properties
    in the region through transactions supplemental to the final system
    plan would promote the establishment and retention of a financially
    self-sustaining rail service system in the region adequate to meet
    the needs of the region, the Secretary or the Association, as the
    case may be, may develop proposals for such supplemental
    transactions as are necessary or appropriate to implement the
    needed restructuring. Transfers of rail properties included in
    proposals developed by the Association shall be limited to (1) rail
    properties which would have qualified for designation under section
    716(c)(1)(A) of this title but which were not transferred or
    conveyed under the final system plan, and which the Association
    finds to be essential to the efficient operations of the
    Corporation, and (2) transfers, consistent with the final system
    plan, of rail properties from the Corporation to a subsidiary
    thereof. Each proposal (other than a proposal developed by the
    Association) shall be submitted in writing to the Association and
    shall state and describe any transactions proposed, the rail
    properties involved, the parties to such transactions, the
    financial and other terms of such transactions, the purposes of the
    chapter or the goals of the final system plan intended to be
    effectuated by such transactions, and such other information
    incidental thereto as the Association may prescribe. Within 10 days
    after receipt of a proposal developed by the Secretary, and upon
    the development of a proposal developed by the Association, the
    Association shall publish a summary of such proposal in the Federal
    Register, and shall afford interested persons (including the
    Corporation when property is to be transferred to or from the
    Corporation) an opportunity to comment thereon.
    (b) Evaluation by Association
      The Association shall analyze each proposal containing one or
    more supplemental transactions, taking into account the comments of
    interested persons and statements and exhibits submitted at any
    public hearings which may have been held. The Association shall,
    within 120 days after the publication of a summary thereof under
    subsection (a) of this section, publish in the Federal Register a
    report evaluating such proposal. Such evaluation shall state
    whether the supplemental transactions contained in such proposal,
    considered in their entirety, are (1) in the public interest and
    consistent with the purposes of this chapter and the goals of the
    final system plan, and (2) fair and equitable. If the Corporation
    opposes, or seeks modification of, any such proposed transfer, its
    written comments shall be given due consideration by the
    Association and shall be published as part of the evaluation.
    Within 30 days after the Association publishes its report, each
    proposed transferor or transferee shall notify the Association in
    writing as to whether any proposed supplemental transaction
    requiring the transfer of any property from or to such transferor
    or transferee is acceptable to such proposed transferor or
    transferee. If any such proposed transferor (other than the
    Corporation) or transferee fails to notify the Association that any
    proposed supplemental transaction requiring the transfer of any
    property from such transferor or to such transferee is acceptable
    to it, no further administrative or judicial proceedings shall be
    conducted with respect to such proposed supplemental transaction.
    (c) Review by Commission
      Within 90 days after the publication in the Federal Register of
    each report referred to in subsection (b) of this section, the
    Commission shall determine whether the supplemental transactions
    referred to in the report, considered in their entirety, would be
    in the public interest and consistent with the purposes of this
    chapter and the goals of the final system plan. In making such
    determination, the Commission shall give due consideration to the
    views received by it, within 30 days after the publication of the
    applicable report, from the Corporation and the Secretary. The
    Commission may condition its approval of such supplemental
    transactions on such reasonable terms and conditions as it may deem
    necessary in the public interest. The approval by the Commission of
    such supplemental transactions shall not be a prerequisite to the
    consummation of such transactions, but any determination of the
    Commission modifying, approving, or disapproving any proposed
    supplemental transactions shall be given due weight and
    consideration by the special court in the proceedings prescribed in
    subsection (d) of this section. If the Commission fails to act
    within the time period provided in this subsection, the
    supplemental transactions involved shall be deemed to have been
    approved by the Commission. The Commission may prescribe such
    regulations as may be necessary for the administration of this
    section.
    (d) Special court proceedings
      (1) If the Association has made the determination pursuant to
    subsection (b) of this section that a proposal for supplemental
    transactions is in the public interest and consistent with the
    purposes of this chapter and the goals of the final system plan,
    and is fair and equitable, the Association shall, within 40 days
    after the date of the Commission's determination under subsection
    (c) of this section, or after the expiration of the 90-day period
    referred to in such subsection (c) of this section, whichever is
    applicable, petition the special court for an order of such court
    finding that such proposal for supplemental transactions is in the
    public interest and consistent with the purposes of this chapter
    and the goals of the final system plan, and is fair and equitable,
    and directing the Corporation to carry out the supplemental
    transactions specified in such proposal. If the Association has
    determined, pursuant to subsection (b) of this section that a
    proposal made by the Secretary is not in the public interest or is
    not consistent with the purposes of this chapter and the goals of
    the final system plan or is not fair and equitable, the Secretary
    may, if he determines that such proposal is in the public interest
    and consistent with the purposes of this chapter and the goals of
    the final system plan and is fair and equitable, petition the
    special court for an order of such court finding that such proposal
    for supplemental transactions is in the public interest and
    consistent with the purposes of this chapter and the goals of the
    final system plan and is fair and equitable, and directing the
    Corporation to carry out any supplemental transactions specified in
    such proposal. Such a petition shall be submitted to the special
    court within 90 days after the date of the Commission's
    determination under such subsection (c) of this section, or after
    the expiration of the 90-day period referred to in such subsection
    (c) of this section, whichever is applicable.
      (2) After the filing of a petition under paragraph (1) of this
    subsection, the special court shall decide, after a hearing,
    whether the proposed supplemental transactions contained in such
    petition, considered in their entirety, are in the public interest
    and consistent with the purposes of this chapter and the goals of
    the final system plan and are fair and equitable. If the special
    court determines that such proposed supplemental transactions,
    considered in their entirety, are in the public interest and
    consistent with the purposes of this chapter and the goals of the
    final system plan and are fair and equitable, it shall, upon making
    such determination, issue such orders as may be necessary to direct
    the Corporation to consummate the transactions. If the special
    court determines that such proposed supplemental transactions,
    considered in their entirety, are not in the public interest or not
    consistent with the purposes of this chapter and the goals of the
    final system plan, or are not fair and equitable, it shall file an
    opinion stating its conclusion and the reasons therefor. In such
    event the Association (in the case of a proposal developed by the
    Association) or the Secretary (in the case of a proposal developed
    by the Secretary) may, within 120 days after the filing of such
    opinion, certify to the special court that the terms and conditions
    of the proposal have been modified consistent with the opinion of
    the court and are acceptable to each proposed transferor (other
    than the Corporation) or transferee, and may petition the special
    court for reconsideration of the proposal as so modified. After the
    filing of such petition, the special court shall decide, after a
    hearing, whether the proposal as modified by the certification is
    in the public interest and consistent with the purposes of this
    chapter and the goals of the final system plan and is fair and
    equitable, and shall enter such further orders as are consistent
    with its determination.
      (3) The Corporation is authorized to petition the special court
    and to be represented regarding any proposed supplemental
    transaction, contained in a proposal developed by either the
    Association or the Secretary, which involves the properties of the
    Corporation.
      (4) In proceedings under this subsection, the special court is
    authorized to exercise the powers of a reorganization court.
      (5) Any evaluation by the Association, the Secretary, or the
    Commission shall not be reviewable in any court except the special
    court in accordance with the provisions of this section. The
    supplemental transactions shall not be restrained or enjoined by
    any court nor shall they be otherwise reviewable by any court other
    than by the special court to the extent provided in this section.
      (6) Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, no
    findings, determinations, or proceedings shall be required with
    respect to any proposal for supplemental transactions other than as
    expressly set forth in this section.
      (7) Repealed. Pub. L. 97-35, title XI, Sec. 1155(b), Aug. 13,
    1981, 95 Stat. 679.
      (8) A final order or judgment of the special court entering or
    denying an order pursuant to this subsection shall be reviewable in
    the same manner as provided in section 719(e)(3) of this title.
    (e) "Fair and equitable" defined
      As used in this section, the term "fair and equitable" means fair
    and equitable, in accordance with the standards applicable to the
    approval of a plan of reorganization (or a step in such plan) under
    section 77 of the Bankruptcy Act (!1) to - 

        (1) the estates of railroads in reorganization in the region
      and persons leased, operated, or controlled by such railroads who
      have conveyed rail properties, under section 743(b)(1) of this
      title, in exchange for securities of the Corporation, the
      Association, or profitable railroads and other benefits provided
      as a consequence of this chapter and to any subsequent holders of
      such securities at the time of the supplemental transaction
      involved; and
        (2) the holders of other securities of the Corporation.

    Whenever any property or securities of the Corporation are required
    to be valued in order to determine whether the terms of a
    supplemental transaction are fair and equitable, the special court
    shall give proper recognition to the contributions to the
    Corporation by all classes of security holders, except that such
    court shall not assign to the series B preferred stock or the
    common stock of the Corporation any values added to those
    securities, by reason of investment by the Association in
    debentures and series A preferred stock of the Corporation, in
    excess of any value required by constitutional principles
    applicable to a reorganization process.
    (f) Expedited proposals
      (1) Within 240 days after the effective date of the Staggers Rail
    Act of 1980, the Secretary, after providing an opportunity for
    comments from interested parties, shall determine whether to
    initiate a proposal for a supplemental transaction under this
    section for the transfer of all rail properties of the Corporation
    in the States of Connecticut and Rhode Island to another railroad
    in the region. If the Secretary determines that - 
        (A) the proposed transferee railroad is financially and
      operationally capable of assuming the freight operations and
      freight service obligations of the Corporation on a financially
      self-sustaining basis;
        (B) the proposed transfer would promote the establishment and
      retention of a financially self-sustaining rail system in the
      States of Connecticut and Rhode Island adequate to meet the needs
      of such States; and
        (C) the proposed transfer is consistent with the goals set
      forth in section 716(a)(8) of this title,

    the Secretary shall develop such a proposal and may, after
    providing the Association, the Commission, and the States of
    Connecticut and Rhode Island an opportunity to review and comment
    on such proposal, petition the special court for an order to carry
    out such proposal.
      (2)(A) Within 10 days after August 13, 1981, the Secretary shall
    initiate discussions and negotiations for the transfer of some or
    all of the Corporation's rail properties and freight service
    obligations in the States of Connecticut and Rhode Island to one or
    more parties under a plan which provides for continued rail freight
    service on all lines operated by the Corporation on August 13,
    1981, for at least four years.
      (B) Within 120 days after August 13, 1981, the Secretary shall
    petition the special court for an order to transfer all of the
    Corporation's rail properties and freight service obligations in
    the States of Connecticut and Rhode Island to one or more railroads
    in the Region - 
        (i) which have under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph
      completed negotiations and submitted to the Secretary a proposal
      to assume all of the freight operations and freight service
      obligations of the Corporation in such States on a financially
      self-sustaining basis for a period of at least four years; or
        (ii) which have developed a proposal to assume all of the
      freight operations and freight service obligations of the
      Corporation in such States under an agreement by and between the
      Corporation and such railroad or railroads; or
        (iii) which have, prior to May 1, 1981, submitted a proposal to
      the Secretary for such a transfer.

    For the purpose of this section, an order to transfer may include
    the Corporation if the Corporation agrees to maintain service over
    lines retained by the Corporation for four years.
      (C) To permit efficient and effective rail operations consistent
    with the public interest, as a part of any transfer under paragraph
    (2)(B) of this subsection, the Secretary shall promote the transfer
    of additional non-mainline Corporation properties in adjoining
    States that connect with properties that are the subject of such
    transfer.
      (D) The special court shall determine a fair and equitable price
    for the rail properties to be transferred under this subsection,
    and shall, unless the parties otherwise agree, establish divisions
    of joint rates for through routes over such properties which are
    fair and equitable to the parties. The special court shall
    establish a method to ensure that such divisions are promptly paid.
      (E) Notwithstanding any other provision of law or agreement in
    effect on May 1, 1981, the special court shall require that the
    railroad or railroads to which properties are to be transferred
    under this subsection assume all charges payable by the Corporation
    to Amtrak for the carriage of property by rail over those portions
    of the Northeast Corridor in Connecticut and Rhode Island. If the
    Corporation operates any rail freight service over those portions
    of the Northeast Corridor in Connecticut and Rhode Island after the
    date of such transfer, the Corporation shall pay Amtrak any
    compensation that may be separately agreed upon by the Corporation
    and Amtrak, and the railroad or railroads to which properties are
    transferred under this subsection shall not be obligated to pay any
    compensation owed by the Corporation to Amtrak for such post-
    transfer operations by the Corporation.
      (3) If the special court determines that a proposal developed
    under this subsection is fair and equitable, meets the requirements
    of this subsection, and is in the public interest, it shall issue
    such orders as may be necessary to carry out such proposal. The
    provisions of paragraphs (2)-(6) of subsection (d) of this section
    shall apply to the determination of the special court under this
    subsection, except that the standards for such determination shall
    be those set forth in this paragraph.
      (4)(A) Any employee who was protected by the compensatory
    provisions of subchapter V (!2) of this chapter immediately prior
    to August 13, 1981, and who is deprived of employment as a result
    of the transfer of rail properties under this subsection shall be
    eligible for benefits under section 797 (!2) of this title.

      (B) As used in this paragraph, "employee deprived of employment"
    means any employee who is unable to secure employment through the
    normal exercise of seniority rights, but does not include any
    employee who refuses an offer of employment with a railroad
    acquiring properties under this subsection.
    (g) Transfer of properties and freight service obligations of
      specific lines
      (1) Within 20 days after August 13, 1981, the Secretary shall
    initiate discussions and negotiations for the expedited transfer of
    all properties and freight service obligations of the Corporation
    with respect to the following lines: Canaan, Connecticut, to
    Pittsfield, Massachusetts; North Adams Junction, Massachusetts, to
    North Adams, Massachusetts; Hazardville, Connecticut, to
    Springfield, Massachusetts; Westfield, Massachusetts, to
    Easthampton, Massachusetts; Westfield, Massachusetts, to Holyoke,
    Massachusetts.
      (2) Within 120 days after August 13, 1981, the Secretary shall
    transfer, provided a qualified purchaser offers to purchase, the
    Corporation's properties and freight service obligations described
    in paragraph (1) of this subsection to another railroad or
    railroads in the Region which are determined by the Secretary to be
    qualified. A qualified purchaser is defined as a railroad
    financially self-sustaining which guarantees continuous service for
    at least four years.
      (3) The Secretary shall determine a fair and equitable price for
    the rail properties to be transferred under this subsection, and
    shall, unless the parties otherwise agree, establish divisions of
    joint rates for through routes over such properties which are fair
    and equitable to the parties.
      (4) The Secretary shall determine fair and equitable terms for
    the provision of such trackage rights, on segments of the
    Corporation's lines not to exceed 5 miles per line transferred, to
    acquiring carriers as may be necessary to operate such transferred
    lines in an efficient manner.

-HEAD-
    Sec. 746. Certificates of value

-STATUTE-
    (a) General
      On the date when the Corporation is required to deposit
    securities with the special court pursuant to section 743(a)(1) of
    this title, the Association shall deposit with the special court
    the certificates of value of the Association required by this
    section. The Secretary shall guarantee the payment of all
    certificates of value delivered in accordance with this subchapter.
    All guarantees entered by the Secretary under this section shall
    constitute general obligations of the United States of America for
    the payment or redemption of which its full faith and credit are
    pledged. Such guarantees shall be valid and incontestable except as
    to mutual mistake of fact or as to fraud or material
    misrepresentation by the holder of such certificates or the
    transferor of rail properties to which certificates of value of any
    series so guaranteed are issued.
    (b) Number and distribution
      A separate series of certificates of value shall be issued to
    each railroad in reorganization in the region and each person
    leased, operated, or controlled by such a railroad that transfers
    rail properties to the Corporation or a subsidiary thereof. The
    number of certificates of value of each series to be deposited
    pursuant to subsection (a) of this section shall be equal to the
    number of shares of series B preferred stock of the Corporation
    which are required to be deposited by the Corporation with the
    special court, pursuant to section 743(a)(1) of this title in
    exchange for the rail properties transferred to the Corporation or
    a subsidiary thereof by such transferor. Certificates of value of
    the appropriate series shall be distributed by the special court,
    pursuant to section 743(c)(4) of this title, at the same time to
    the same transferors, and in the same numbers of units as shares of
    such series B preferred stock are distributed to such transferor.
    (c) Redemption
      (1) Certificates of value, of any series, shall be redeemed by
    the Association on December 31, 1987, or on such earlier date as
    the Board of Directors of the Association and the Finance Committee
    jointly may determine and specify.
      (2) Each certificate of value of each series shall be redeemable
    for an amount, payable in cash, equal to its base value on the
    redemption date, minus - 
        (A) the sum of the fair market value of the series B preferred
      stock applicable to such certificate, the fair market value of
      the common stock applicable to such certificate, and all cash
      dividends theretofore paid on any such series B preferred stock
      and on any such common stock; and
        (B) any sums paid to a transferor of rail properties to whom
      such series of certificates of value was issued resulting from
      sales or leases by the Corporation of properties transferred to
      it by such transferor divided by the number of certificates of
      value distributed to such transferor.

      (3) The number of shares of series B preferred stock and common
    stock applicable to each certificate of value of any series,
    pursuant to paragraph (2) of this subsection, shall be - 
        (A) one share of series B preferred stock (adjusted to reflect
      any stock splits, stock combinations, reclassifications or
      similar transactions affecting the number of shares of
      outstanding series B preferred stock following the date of
      distribution pursuant to section 743(c)(4) of this title); and
        (B) the number of shares of common stock determined by dividing
      the total number of shares of common stock distributed pursuant
      to section 743(c)(4) of this title to the transferor receiving
      such series of certificates of value (adjusted to reflect any
      stock splits, stock combinations, reclassifications, or similar
      transactions affecting the number of shares of outstanding common
      stock following the date of distribution pursuant to section
      743(c)(4) of this title) by the total number of certificates of
      value in the series so distributed to such transferor.

      (4) The base value of each certificate of value of any series
    shall be the value obtained by (A) taking the net liquidation
    value, as determined by the special court, to which the transferor
    to whom such series of certificates of value is issued is entitled
    by virtue of transfers of rail properties, under section 743(b)(1)
    of this title to the Corporation or a subsidiary thereof; (B)
    subtracting the value of other benefits provided under this
    chapter, as determined by the special court; (C) adding such
    amount, if any, as the special court may determine shall be
    required after taking into consideration compensable
    unconstitutional erosion, if any, in the estate of a railroad in
    reorganization, or of a railroad leased, operated, or controlled by
    such a railroad, which the special court finds to have occurred
    during any bankruptcy proceeding with respect to such railroad; (D)
    adding interest from the transfer date to the redemption date to be
    compounded annually at a rate of 8 percent per annum; and (E)
    dividing the resulting value by the number of certificates of value
    of such series distributed to such transferor. In determining such
    base value, the special court shall give due weight and
    consideration to the finding of the Association as to the net
    liquidation value to which each transferor is entitled by virtue of
    conveyances of rail properties under section 743(b)(1) of this
    title. For purposes of this paragraph, the term "rail properties"
    includes all rights with respect to employee benefit plans
    transferred and assigned to the Corporation pursuant to section
    743(b)(6) of this title. Net liquidation value with respect to such
    rights shall be determined after taking into account all
    obligations finally transferred or assigned to the Corporation
    pursuant to such section.
      (5) The fair market value of series B preferred stock and of
    common stock of the Corporation shall be determined in accordance
    with regulations prescribed by the Association, on the basis of the
    average price of each such security in the primary established
    market in which such securities are traded over a period of 120
    consecutive trading days ending not less than 20 nor more than 40
    trading days preceding the redemption date, or, in the case of a
    security for which there is not an established trading market, on
    the basis of the fair market value thereof as determined by the
    majority vote of three experts in the valuation of securities, one
    to be selected by the Association, one to be selected by the
    directors of the Corporation elected by the holders of the security
    to be valued, and one to be selected by the two first selected.
    (d) Authorization of appropriations

-STATUTE-
    (a) Audit
      (1) The Comptroller General of the United States is authorized to
    audit the programs, activities, and financial operations of the
    Corporation for any period during which (A) Federal funds provided
    pursuant to this chapter are being used to finance any portion of
    its operations, or (B) Federal funds have been invested therein
    pursuant to this chapter. Any such audit may be conducted under
    such rules and regulations as the Comptroller General may
    prescribe. The Comptroller General shall report to the Congress at
    such times and to such extent as he considers necessary to keep the
    Congress informed on the security of such Federal funds and
    guarantees and, to the extent appropriate, make recommendations for
    achieving greater economy, efficiency, and effectiveness in such
    programs, activities, and operations.
      (2) For the purpose of any audit conducted pursuant to subsection
    (a) of this section, the Comptroller General, or a designated
    representative of the Comptroller General, shall have access to and
    the right to examine all books, accounts, records, reports, files,
    and other papers, items, or property belonging to or in use by the
    Corporation.
    (b) Report
      The Association shall prepare and submit an annual report to
    Congress on the performance of the Corporation in order to keep the
    Congress informed as to matters which may affect the quality of
    rail services in the region and which may affect the security of
    Federal funds referred to in subsection (a) of this section. Each
    such report shall be submitted within 150 days after the end of the
    fiscal year of the Corporation. Each such report shall include an
    evaluation of - 
        (1) the degree to which the goals of section 716(a) of this
      title are being met;
        (2) the amounts and causes of deviations, if any, from the
      financial projections of the final system plan;
        (3) the amount of Federal funds made available to the
      Corporation and a clear description of the uses of such funds;
        (4) the projected financial needs of the Corporation;
        (5) the projected sources from which such financial needs are
      likely to be met; and
        (6) the ability of the Corporation to become financially self-
      sustaining without requiring Federal funds in excess of those
      authorized by section 716(f) of this title.
    (c) Monitoring of Corporation
      (1) The Association shall also report to the Congress, in
    accordance with this subsection, on the policies of the Corporation
    and the results of such policies with respect to operations, cost
    containment, and marketing.
      (2) Within 90 days after November 1, 1978, the Association shall
    (A) subdivide each such policy area into constituent parts or
    groups of parts which are specific and significant, (B) identify
    the most appropriate indicia to reflect accurately such parts or
    groups of parts, and (C)(i) determine any and all deficiencies in
    data used to compute the values of such indicia including
    consistency and clarity of definitions, timeliness of data entry,
    editing and validation of input data, and processing, and (ii)
    outline the efforts of the Association and Corporation to correct
    the deficiencies and the results of such efforts. On or before the
    end of such 90-day period, the Association shall submit to the
    Congress such methodological information and additional information
    which the Association deems necessary or appropriate to further the
    purpose of this subchapter.
      (3) Using such indicia, the Association shall report on (A) the
    relationship of each constituent part or groups of parts to the
    Corporation's revenue and capital and operating expenses, (B) the
    extent to which such parts or group of parts contributes to profits
    or losses, (C) the efforts of management to contain or reduce the
    contribution of such part or group of parts to losses, (D) the
    results of such efforts, and (E) such other information as the
    Association deems necessary or appropriate.
      (4) The Association shall (A) transmit to the Congress the first
    such monitoring report pursuant to paragraph (3) at the end of the
    first calendar quarter which begins after the end of the 90-day
    period for preparation and submission of the methodological
    information pursuant to paragraph (2), (B) report such monitoring
    information to the Congress at the end of the first quarter of each
    calendar year thereafter, (C) update methodological and monitoring
    information periodically as the Association deems necessary or
    appropriate, but in no case less frequently than once a year, and
    (D) where the results of such updating are statistically
    significant or relevant to Congressional policymaking, report them
    and the reasons for their significance at the end of the calendar
    quarter in which the updating occurred.

-STATUTE-
    (a) General
      The Corporation may, in accordance with this section, file with
    the Commission an application for a certificate of abandonment for
    any line which is part of the system of the Corporation. Any such
    application shall be governed by this section and shall not, except
    as specifically provided in this section, be subject to the
    provisions of chapter 109 of title 49.
    (b) Applications for abandonment
      Any application for abandonment that is filed by the Corporation
    under this section before December 1, 1981, shall be granted by the
    Commission within 90 days after the date such application is filed
    unless, within such 90-day period, an offer of financial assistance
    is made in accordance with subsection (d) of this section with
    respect to the line to be abandoned.
    (c) Notice of insufficient revenues
      (1) The Corporation may, prior to November 1, 1985, file with the
    Commission a notice of insufficient revenues for any line which is
    part of the system of the Corporation.
      (2) At any time after the 90-day period beginning with the filing
    of a notice of insufficient revenues for a line, the Corporation
    may file an application for abandonment for such line. An
    application for abandonment that is filed by the Corporation under
    this subsection for a line for which a notice of insufficient
    revenues was filed under paragraph (1) shall be granted by the
    Commission within 90 days after the date such application is filed
    unless, within such 90-day period, an offer of financial assistance
    is made in accordance with subsection (d) of this section with
    respect to such line.
    (d) Offers of financial assistance
      (1) The provisions of section 10904 of title 49 (including the

    an offer of financial assistance under subsection (b) or (c) of
    this section with such information as the Commission may require.
    (e) Liquidation
      (1) If any application for abandonment is granted under
    subsection (b) of this section, the Commission shall, as soon as
    practicable, appraise the net liquidation value of the line to be
    abandoned, and shall publish notice of such appraisal in the
    Federal Register.
      (2) Appraisals made under paragraph (1) shall not be appealable.
      (3)(A) If, within 120 days after the date on which an appraisal
    is published in the Federal Register under paragraph (1), the
    Corporation receives a bona fide offer for the sale, for 75 percent
    of the amount at which the liquidation value of such line was
    appraised by the Commission, of the line to be abandoned, the
    Corporation shall sell such line and the Commission shall, unless
    the parties otherwise agree, establish an equitable division of
    joint rates for through routes over such lines.
      (B) If the Corporation receives no bona fide offer under
    subparagraph (A), within such 120-day period, the Corporation may
    abandon or dispose of the line as it chooses, except that the
    Corporation may not dismantle bridges, or other structures (not
    including rail, signals, and other rail facilities) for 120 days
    thereafter. The Secretary may require that bridges or other
    structures (not including rail, signals, and other rail
    facilities), not be dismantled for an additional 8 months if he
    assumes all liability of any sort related to such property.
      (4) If the purchaser under paragraph (3)(A) of this subsection of

    deprived of employment by such an abandonment shall be eligible for
    employee protection under section 797 (!2) of this title.

      (1) Except as specifically provided in paragraph (2) of this
    subsection, no provision of this chapter shall be deemed to convey
    to any railroad or employee or director thereof any immunity from
    civil or criminal liability, or to create defenses to actions,
    under the antitrust laws.
      (2) The antitrust laws are inapplicable with respect to any
    action taken to formulate or implement the final system plan where
    such action was in compliance with the requirements of such plan
    and with respect to any action taken to formulate or implement any
    supplemental transaction.
      (3) As used in this subsection, "antitrust laws" includes the Act
    of July 2, 1890 (ch. 647, 26 Stat. 209), as amended; the Act of
    October 15, 1914 (ch. 323, 38 Stat. 730), as amended; the Federal
    Trade Commission Act (38 Stat. 717), as amended [15 U.S.C. 41 et
    seq.], sections 73 and 74 of the Act of August 27, 1894 (28 Stat.
    570), as amended [15 U.S.C. 8, 9]; the Act of June 19, 1936 (ch.
    592, 49 Stat. 1526), as amended; and the antitrust laws of any
    State or subdivision thereof.
    (b) Commerce, securities, and bankruptcy
      (1) The provisions of subtitle IV of title 49 and the Bankruptcy
    Act, are inapplicable (A) to actions taken under this chapter to
    formulate and implement the final system plan where such action was
    in compliance with the requirements of such plan, and (B) to
    actions taken under this chapter to formulate or implement any
    supplemental transaction.
      (2) All securities of the Corporation which are issued to the
    Association as the initial holder, or which are issued in
    connection with the transfer to the Corporation or a subsidiary
    thereof of rail properties under this chapter, shall be deemed for
    all purposes to have been issued subject to and authorized pursuant
    to section 11301 (!1) of title 49.

      (3) The provisions of section 77e of title 15, shall not apply to
    transactions involving the issuance of any security of the

    special court pursuant to section 743(a) of this title, or
    transactions involving the issuance or distribution of any security

    the Bankruptcy Act, with respect to a railroad in reorganization in
    the region which conveys all or substantially all of its designated
    rail properties to the Corporation or a subsidiary thereof, or to
    profitable railroads in the region, pursuant to the final system
    plan, and the requirement that plans of reorganization be filed
    with the Commission, shall cease upon the date of such conveyance.
    The powers and duties of the Commission under section 77 of the
    Bankruptcy Act shall also so terminate, as of February 5, 1976,
    with respect to any railroad in reorganization under such section
    77 but not subject to this chapter which (1) does not operate any
    line of railroad, and (2) has transferred all or substantially all
    of its rail properties to a railroad in reorganization in the
    region which was subject to this chapter prior to February 5, 1976.
    Thereafter, such powers and duties of the Commission shall be
    vested in the district court of the United States which has
    jurisdiction of the estate of any such railroad in reorganization
    at the time of such conveyance. Such court shall proceed to
    reorganize or liquidate such railroad in reorganization pursuant to
    such section 77 on such terms as the court deems just and
    reasonable, or pursuant to any other provisions of the Bankruptcy
    Act, if the court finds that such action would be in the best
    interests of such estate. This paragraph does not affect any
    obligation of any carrier by railroad subject to regulation under
    subtitle IV of title 49. The powers and duties of the Commission
    under section 77 of the Bankruptcy Act shall continue in effect
    only to the extent that the railroad in reorganization continues to
    operate any line of railroad.

    not apply thereafter to any action taken in compliance with the
    requirements of the final system plan.

    the Corporation.
      (2) Properties acquired by purchase, lease, or otherwise pursuant
    to this subsection shall be improved in order to meet the goal set
    forth in section 716(a)(3) of this title, relating to improved

    the sale date [Apr. 2, 1987, see 45 U.S.C. 702(17A)].
    Notwithstanding this repeal - 
        "(1) any dispute or controversy regarding benefits under
      section 701 shall be determined under the terms of the law in
      effect prior to such repeal; and
        "(2) the Railroad Retirement Board shall take such actions as

    Conrail's Agreement Employees' and Appendix 3 thereto, together
    with any amendments thereto, or under any other terms and
    conditions as shall be agreed between the Corporation and the
    representatives of its employees.
      "(2) The Corporation shall pay, as designated by the Railroad
    Retirement Board, any remaining benefits under section 701 of the
    Regional Rail Reorganization Act of 1973 [45 U.S.C. 797] that
    accrued, but were not disbursed, prior to the sale date.
      "(3) The Railroad Retirement Board shall transfer to the
    Corporation such information regarding administration of the labor
    protection program under such section 701 as may be reasonably
    necessary for the Corporation to discharge its responsibilities
    under this subsection, including copies of the individual claim
    records of employees of the Corporation.
      "(4) The United States shall have no liability for benefits under
    this subsection.
      "(e) Compensation for Wages Below Industry Standard. - The
    Corporation shall pay $200,000,000 to present and former employees
    subject to collective bargaining agreements, in accordance with the
    terms and conditions in the Definitive Agreement referred to in
    subsection (d)(1), or as otherwise agreed between the parties.
      "(f) ESOP Transactions. - (1) As soon as practicable after the
    date of the enactment of this Act [Oct. 21, 1986], the employee
    stock ownership plan of the Corporation (hereafter in this
    subsection referred to as the 'ESOP') shall be amended to provide
    that - 
        "(A) the shares of the ConRail Equity Corporation preferred
      stock held by the ESOP shall be surrendered by the ESOP in
      exchange for an equal number of shares of the common stock of the
      Corporation, and such common stock of the Corporation shall be
      allocated by the ESOP to the same persons in the same amounts as
      the shares of ConRail Equity Corporation preferred stock had been
      allocated; and
        "(B) the remaining shares of the ConRail Equity Corporation
      preferred stock held by the Corporation shall be cancelled, and
      an equal number of shares of the common stock of the Corporation
      shall be contributed by the Corporation to the ESOP, which shares
      shall be allocated by the ESOP to persons who are or were ESOP
      participants in accordance with the formula set forth in section
      2 of Article II of Part III of the Definitive Agreement referred
      to in subsection (d)(1), and in accordance with a comparable
      formula for present and former employees of the Corporation not
      covered by such section of the Definitive Agreement, except that
      no contribution by the Corporation to the ESOP shall be made
      which would affect the tax-qualified status of the ESOP, or of
      any of the employee benefit plans maintained by the Corporation
      or any affiliate of the Corporation, under the Internal Revenue
      Code of 1986 [26 U.S.C. 1 et seq.].
      "(2)(A)(i) As soon as practicable after the expiration of 180
    days after 100 percent of the United States shares are sold, the
    ESOP shall distribute all of the stock in the accounts of its
    participants and beneficiaries, except as provided in clause (ii).
      "(ii) Fractional shares shall not be distributed under clause
    (i). Shares equal to the aggregate amount of fractional shares
    shall be surrendered by the ESOP and redeemed by the Corporation
    for cash at the average closing price for the common stock of the
    Corporation on a national securities exchange for the 10 business
    days immediately preceding the date of distribution under clause
    (i), or, if the common stock of the Corporation is not listed on a
    national securities exchange, at the average closing price for such
    stock for such 10 business days as appearing in any regularly
    published reporting or quotation service, and the proceeds of such
    redemption shall be distributed by the ESOP to the same
    participants and beneficiaries and in the same amounts as the
    fractional shares had been allocated.
      "(B) After completing the distribution under subparagraph (A),
    the ESOP shall terminate.
      "(3) The Corporation shall distribute any full shares of its
    common stock which, because of the exception under paragraph
    (1)(B), could not be contributed to the ESOP to those persons to
    whom the ESOP would have allocated such shares pursuant to
    paragraph (1)(B) had such shares been contributed to the ESOP. The
    Corporation shall pay cash pursuant to the formula set forth in
    paragraph (2)(A)(ii) in lieu of fractional shares.
      "(4) For purposes of Rule 144 promulgated under the Securities
    Act of 1933 [15 U.S.C. 77a et seq.], each share of the common stock
    of the Corporation distributed under this subsection shall be
    deemed to have been beneficially owned by the recipient, as of the
    date of such distribution, for a period of 3 years."

    Sec. 797a. Termination allowance

-STATUTE-
    (a) General
      The Corporation may terminate the employment of certain
    employees, in accordance with this section, upon the payment of an
    allowance of $350 for each month of active service with the
    Corporation or with a railroad in reorganization, but in no event
    may any such termination allowance exceed $25,000.
    (b) Employment needs
      Within 90 days after August 13, 1981, the Corporation shall
    determine, for each location, the number of employees that the
    Corporation intends to separate under subsection (a) of this
    section.
    (c) Notification and separation procedure
      (1) Within 90 days after August 13, 1981, the Corporation shall
    notify its employees of their rights and responsibilities under
    this section.
      (2) Within 90 days after August 13, 1981, the Corporation shall
    notify each train and engine service employee eligible to be
    separated under paragraph (3) that such employee may be entitled to
    receive a separation payment under this section if such employee
    files a written request to be separated. Such notice may be revised
    from time to time.
      (3) If the number of employees who request to be separated
    pursuant to paragraph (2) of this subsection is greater, in engine
    service at any location, than the number of excess firemen at the
    location, and in train service at the location than the number of
    excess second and third brakemen, as determined by the Corporation,
    the Corporation shall separate the employees described in paragraph
    (2) of this subsection in order of seniority beginning with the
    most senior employee, until the excess firemen and second and third
    brakemen positions at that location, as determined by the
    Corporation, have been eliminated.
    (d) Designated separations
      If the number of employees who are separated pursuant to
    subsection (c)(3) of this section is less at any location than the
    number of excess firemen in freight and commuter service and second
    and third brakemen in freight service at such location, as
    determined by the Corporation, the Corporation may, after 210 days
    after August 13, 1981, designate for separation employees in engine
    service or train service respectively in inverse order of
    seniority, beginning with the most junior employee in active
    service at such location until the excess firemen in freight and
    commuter service and second and third brakemen in freight service,
    at that location have been eliminated. An employee designated under
    this subsection may choose (1) to furlough himself voluntarily, in
    which case the next most junior employee protected under the
    fireman manning or crew consist agreements or any other agreement
    or law, in the same craft or class at such location may be
    separated instead and receive the separation allowance, or (2) to
    exercise his seniority to another location, in which case the
    Corporation may separate, under the provisions of this subsection,
    the next most junior protected employee in active service at the
    location to which seniority ultimately is exercised.
    (e) Effect on positions
      (1) The Corporation shall refrain from filling one fireman
    position in freight service, or in commuter service where
    applicable, for each employee in engine service separated in
    accordance with this section.
      (2) The Corporation may refrain from filling one brakeman
    position in excess of one conductor and one brakeman on one crew in
    freight service for each employee in train service who is separated
    in accordance with this section.
      (3) Positions permitted to be not filled under this subsection
    shall be not filled in different types of freight service actually
    operated at or from the location in a sequence to be agreed upon
    between the Corporation and the general chairman representative of
    classes or crafts of employees having jurisdiction over the
    positions to be not filled. If no such agreement is reached, the
    Corporation may designate the position to be not filled.
      (4) Notwithstanding paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subsection,
    the Corporation shall retain all rights it has under any provision
    of law or agreement to refrain from filling any position of
    employment.
    (f) Procedures
      The Corporation and representatives of the various classes and
    crafts of employees to be separated may agree on procedures to
    implement this section, but the absence of such agreement shall not
    interfere with implementation of the separations authorized by this
    section.
    (g) Commuter employees
      The provisions of this section shall apply to the separation of
    firemen in commuter service, except that with respect to such
    employees the Corporation is required to make the separations
    authorized by this section.

      Any employee who is deprived of employment shall have the first
    right of hire by any other railroad for a vacancy for which he is
    qualified in a class or craft (or in the case of a non-agreement
    employee, for a non-agreement vacancy) in which such employee was
    employed by the Corporation or a predecessor carrier for not less
    than one year, except where such a vacancy is covered by (1) an
    affirmative action plan, or a hiring plan designed to eliminate
    discrimination, that is required by Federal or State statute,
    regulation, or Executive order, or by the order of a Federal court
    or agency, or (2) a permissible voluntary affirmative action plan.
    For purposes of this section, a railroad shall not be considered to
    be hiring new employees when it recalls any of its own furloughed
    employees.
    (b) Status
      The first right of hire afforded to employees under this section
    shall be coequal to the first right of hire afforded under sections

-STATUTE-
    (a) Register
      (1) The Railroad Retirement Board (hereafter in this section
    referred to as the "Board") shall prepare and maintain a register
    of persons separated from railroad employment after at least one
    year of completed service with a railroad who have declared their
    current availability for employment in the railroad industry. The
    register shall be subdivided by class and craft of prior employment
    and shall be updated periodically to reflect current availability.
      (2) Each entry in the register shall include, or provide access
    to, basic information concerning the individual's experience and
    qualifications.
      (3) The Board shall place at the top of the register those former
    railroad employees entitled to priority under applicable provisions
    of law, including this chapter.
    (b) Corporation employees
      As soon as is practicable after August 13, 1981, the Corporation
    shall provide to the Board the names of its former employees who
    elect to appear on the register and who have not been offered
    employment with acquiring railroads.
    (c) Vacancy notices; warning; civil penalty
      (1) Each railroad shall timely file with the Board a notice of
    vacancy with respect to any position for which the railroad intends
    to accept applications from persons other than current employees of
    that carrier.
      (2)(A) As soon as the Board becomes aware of any failure on the
    part of a railroad to comply with paragraph (1), the Board shall
    issue a warning to such railroad of its potential liability under
    subparagraph (B).
      (B) Any railroad failing to comply with paragraph (1) of this
    subsection after being warned by the Board under subparagraph (A)
    shall be liable for a civil penalty in the amount of $500 for each
    subsequent vacancy with respect to which such railroad has so
    failed to comply.
    (d) Placement
      The Board shall, through distribution of copies of the central
    register (or portions thereof) to railroads and representatives of
    classes or crafts of employees and through publication of
    employment information derived from vacancy notices filed with the
    Board, promote the placement of former railroad employees
    possessing requisite skills and experience in appropriate positions
    with other railroads.
    (e) Employment applications
      In addition to its responsibilities under subsections (a) through
    (d) of this section, the Board shall facilitate the filing of
    employment applications with respect to current vacancies in the
    industry by former railroad employees entitled to priority under
    applicable provisions of law, including this chapter.
    (f) Expiration
      The provisions of this section shall cease to be effective on the
    expiration of the 6-year period beginning on August 13, 1981.
    (g) Resolution of disputes
      Any dispute, grievance, or claim arising under this section,
    section 797b of this title, section 907 of this title, or section
    1004 of this title shall be subject to resolution in accordance
    with the following procedures:
        (1) Any employee with such a dispute, grievance, or claim may
      petition the Board to review and investigate the dispute,
      grievance, or claim.
        (2) The Board shall investigate the dispute, grievance, or
      claim, and if it concludes that the employee's rights under this
      section, section 797b of this title, section 907 of this title,
      or section 1004 of this title may have been violated, the
      dispute, grievance, or claim shall be subject to resolution in
      accordance with the procedures set forth in section 153 of this
      title.
        (3) In the case of any violation of this section, section 797b
      of this title, section 907 of this title, or section 1004 of this
      title, the Adjustment Board (or any division or delegate thereof)
      or any other board of adjustment created under section 153 of
      this title shall, where appropriate, award such relief, including
      back pay, as may be necessary to enforce the employee's rights.

-STATUTE-
    (a) General
      With respect to any craft or class of employees not covered by a
    collective bargaining agreement that provides for a process

    reallocate, and consolidate work formerly performed on the rail
    properties acquired pursuant to the provisions of this chapter from
    a railroad in reorganization to any location, facility, or position
    on its system if it does not remove such work from coverage of a
    collective bargaining agreement and does not infringe upon the
    existing classification of work rights of any craft or class of
    employees at the location or facility to which such work is
    assigned, allocated, reassigned, reallocated, or consolidated.
    Prior to the exercise of authority under this subsection, the
    Corporation shall negotiate an agreement with the representatives
    of the employees involved permitting such employees the right to
    follow their work.

      All work in connection with the operation or services provided by
    the Corporation on the rail lines, properties, equipment, or
    facilities acquired pursuant to the provisions of this chapter and
    the maintenance, repair, rehabilitation, or modernization of such

    performed by practice or agreement in accordance with provisions of
    the existing contracts in effect with the representatives of the
    employees of the classes or crafts involved shall continue to be
    performed by the Corporation's employees, including employees on
    furlough. Should the Corporation lack a sufficient number of
    employees, including employees on furlough, and be unable to hire
    additional employees, to perform the work required, it shall be
    permitted to subcontract that part of such work which cannot be
    performed by its employees, including those on furlough, except
    where agreement by the representatives of the employees of the
    classes or crafts involved is required by applicable collective-

    pursuant to the provisions of this chapter, the representatives of
    the various classes or crafts of employees of a railroad in
    reorganization involved in a conveyance and representatives of the
    Corporation shall commence negotiation of a new single collective
    bargaining agreement for each class and craft of employees covering
    the rate of pay, rules, and working conditions of employees who are
    the employees of the Corporation. Such collective bargaining
    agreement shall include appropriate provisions concerning rates of
    pay, rules, and working conditions, but shall not, before April 1,
    1984, include any provisions for job stabilization which may exceed
    or conflict with those established herein. Negotiations with
    respect to such single collective bargaining agreement, and any
    successor thereto, shall be conducted systemwide.

    first single collective bargaining agreement for any class or
    craft, agreed upon before August 13, 1981, shall be completed no
    later than 45 days after August 13, 1981. Such agreed upon
    procedure shall be deemed to satisfy the requirements of sections
    157 and 158 of this title. The National Mediation Board shall
    appoint any person as provided for by such agreements.
      (2) Nothing in this section shall be construed to require the
    parties to enter into a new single collective bargaining agreement
    if the agreement between the parties in effect immediately prior to
    August 13, 1981, complied with section 774(d) (!1) of this title as
    in effect immediately prior to such date.

-STATUTE-
    (a) Liability for employee claims
      In all cases of claims, prior to April 1, 1976, by employees,
    arising under the collective bargaining agreements of the railroads
    in reorganization in the Region, and subject to section 153 of this
    title, the Corporation, the National Railroad Passenger
    Corporation, or an acquiring carrier, as the case may be, shall
    assume responsibility for the processing of any such claims, and
    payment of those which are sustained or settled on or subsequent to
    the date of conveyance, under section 743(b)(1) of this title, and
    shall be entitled to direct reimbursement from the Association
    pursuant to section 721(h) of this title, to the extent that such
    claims are determined by the Association to be the obligation of a
    railroad in reorganization in the Region. Any liability of an
    estate of a railroad in reorganization to its employees which is
    assumed, processed, and paid pursuant to this subsection by the
    Corporation, the National Railroad Passenger Corporation, or an
    acquiring carrier shall remain the preconveyance obligation of the
    estate of such railroad for purposes of section 721(h)(1) of this
    title. The Corporation, the National Railroad Passenger
    Corporation, an acquiring carrier, or the Association, as the case
    may be, shall be entitled to a direct claim as a current expense of
    administration, in accordance with the provisions of section 721(h)
    of this title (other than paragraph (4)(A) thereof), for
    reimbursement (including costs and expenses of processing such
    claims) from the estate of the railroad in reorganization on whose
    behalf such obligations are discharged or paid. In those cases in
    which claims for employees were sustained or settled prior to such
    date of conveyance, it shall be the obligation of the employees to
    seek satisfaction against the estate of the railroads in
    reorganization which were their former employers.
    (b) Assumption of personal injury claims
      All cases or claims by employees or their personal
    representatives for personal injuries or death against a railroad
    in reorganization in the Region arising prior to the date of
    conveyance of rail properties, pursuant to section 743 of this
    title, shall be assumed by the Corporation or an acquiring
    railroad, as the case may be. The Corporation or the acquiring
    railroad shall process and pay any such claims that are sustained
    or settled, and shall be entitled to direct reimbursement from the
    Association pursuant to section 721(h) of this title, to the extent
    that such claims are determined by the Association or its successor
    authority to be the obligation of such railroad. Any liability of
    an estate of a railroad in reorganization which is assumed,
    processed, and paid, pursuant to this subsection, by the
    Corporation or an acquiring railroad shall remain the preconveyance
    obligation of the estate of such railroad for purposes of section
    721(h)(1) of this title. The Corporation, an acquiring railroad, or
    the Association, as the case may be, shall be entitled to a direct
    claim as a current expense of administration, in accordance with
    the provisions of section 721(h) of this title (other than
    paragraph (4)(A) thereof), for reimbursement (including costs and
    expenses of processing such claims) from the estate of the railroad
    in reorganization on whose behalf such obligations were discharged
    or paid.

-STATUTE-
    (a) Purpose
      It is the purpose of the Congress in this Act to provide the
    means to rehabilitate and maintain the physical facilities, improve
    the operations and structure, and restore the financial stability
    of the railway system of the United States, and to promote the
    revitalization of such railway system, so that this mode of
    transportation will remain viable in the private sector of the
    economy and will be able to provide energy-efficient, ecologically
    compatible transportation services with greater efficiency,
    effectiveness, and economy, through - 
        (1) ratemaking and regulatory reform;
        (2) the encouragement of efforts to restructure the system on a
      more economically justified basis, including planning authority
      in the Secretary of Transportation, an expedited procedure for
      determining whether merger and consolidation applications are in
      the public interest, and continuing reorganization authority;
        (3) financing mechanisms that will assure adequate
      rehabilitation and improvement of facilities and equipment,
      implementation of the final system plan, and implementation of
      the Northeast Corridor project;
        (4) transitional continuation of service on light-density rail
      lines that are necessary to continued employment and community
      well-being throughout the United States;
        (5) auditing, accounting, reporting, and other requirements to
      protect Federal funds and to assure repayment of loans and
      financial responsibility; and
        (6) necessary studies.
    (b) Policy
      It is declared to be the policy of the Congress in this Act to - 
        (1) balance the needs of carriers, shippers, and the public;
        (2) foster competition among all carriers by railroad and other
      modes of transportation, to promote more adequate and efficient
      transportation services, and to increase the attractiveness of
      investing in railroads and rail-service-related enterprises;
        (3) permit railroads greater freedom to raise or lower rates
      for rail services in competitive markets;
        (4) promote the establishment of railroad rate structures which
      are more sensitive to changes in the level of seasonal, regional,
      and shipper demand;
        (5) promote separate pricing of distinct rail and rail-related
      services;
        (6) formulate standards and guidelines for determining adequate
      revenue levels for railroads; and
        (7) modernize and clarify the functions of railroad rate
      bureaus.

    Sec. 821. Definitions

-STATUTE-
      For purposes of this subchapter:
        (1)(A) The term "cost" means the estimated long-term cost to
      the Government of a direct loan or loan guarantee or modification
      thereof, calculated on a net present value basis, excluding
      administrative costs and any incidental effects on governmental
      receipts or outlays.
        (B) The cost of a direct loan shall be the net present value,
      at the time when the direct loan is disbursed, of the following
      estimated cash flows:
          (i) Loan disbursements.
          (ii) Repayments of principal.
          (iii) Payments of interest and other payments by or to the
        Government over the life of the loan after adjusting for
        estimated defaults, prepayments, fees, penalties, and other
        recoveries.

      Calculation of the cost of a direct loan shall include the
      effects of changes in loan terms resulting from the exercise by
      the borrower of an option included in the loan contract.
        (C) The cost of a loan guarantee shall be the net present
      value, at the time when the guaranteed loan is disbursed, of the
      following estimated cash flows:
          (i) Payments by the Government to cover defaults and
        delinquencies, interest subsidies, or other payments.
          (ii) Payments to the Government, including origination and
        other fees, penalties, and recoveries.

      Calculation of the cost of a loan guarantee shall include the
      effects of changes in loan terms resulting from the exercise by
      the guaranteed lender of an option included in the loan guarantee
      contract, or by the borrower of an option included in the
      guaranteed loan contract.
        (D) The cost of a modification is the difference between the
      current estimate of the net present value of the remaining cash
      flows under the terms of a direct loan or loan guarantee
      contract, and the current estimate of the net present value of
      the remaining cash flows under the terms of the contract, as
      modified.
        (E) In estimating net present values, the discount rate shall
      be the average interest rate on marketable Treasury securities of
      similar maturity to the cash flows of the direct loan or loan
      guarantee for which the estimate is being made.
        (F) When funds are obligated for a direct loan or loan
      guarantee, the estimated cost shall be based on the current
      assumptions, adjusted to incorporate the terms of the loan
      contract, for the fiscal year in which the funds are obligated.
        (2) The term "current" has the same meaning as in section
      900(c)(9) of title 2.
        (3) The term "direct loan" means a disbursement of funds by the
      Government to a non-Federal borrower under a contract that
      requires the repayment of such funds. The term includes the
      purchase of, or participation in, a loan made by another lender
      and financing arrangements that defer payment for more than 90
      days, including the sale of a Government asset on credit terms.
      The term does not include the acquisition of a federally
      guaranteed loan in satisfaction of default claims.
        (4) The term "direct loan obligation" means a binding agreement
      by the Secretary to make a direct loan when specified conditions
      are fulfilled by the borrower.
        (5) The term "intermodal" means of or relating to the
      connection between rail service and other modes of
      transportation, including all parts of facilities at which such
      connection is made.
        (6) The term "loan guarantee" means any guarantee, insurance,
      or other pledge with respect to the payment of all or a part of
      the principal or interest on any debt obligation of a non-Federal
      borrower to a non-Federal lender, but does not include the
      insurance of deposits, shares, or other withdrawable accounts in
      financial institutions.
        (7) The term "loan guarantee commitment" means a binding
      agreement by the Secretary to make a loan guarantee when
      specified conditions are fulfilled by the borrower, the lender,
      or any other party to the guarantee agreement.
        (8) The term "modification" means any Government action that
      alters the estimated cost of an outstanding direct loan (or
      direct loan obligation) or an outstanding loan guarantee (or loan
      guarantee commitment) from the current estimate of cash flows.
      This includes the sale of loan assets, with or without recourse,
      and the purchase of guaranteed loans. This also includes any
      action resulting from new legislation, or from the exercise of
      administrative discretion under existing law, that directly or
      indirectly alters the estimated cost of outstanding direct loans
      (or direct loan obligations) or loan guarantees (or loan
      guarantee commitments) such as a change in collection procedures.

        (1) State and local governments;
        (2) interstate compacts consented to by Congress under section
      410(a) of the Amtrak Reform and Accountability Act of 1997 (49
      U.S.C. 24101 note);
        (3) government sponsored authorities and corporations;
        (4) railroads;
        (5) joint ventures that include at least one railroad; and
        (6) solely for the purpose of constructing a rail connection
      between a plant or facility and a second rail carrier, limited
      option rail freight shippers that own or operate a plant or other
      facility that is served by no more than a single railroad.
    (b) Eligible purposes
      (1) In general
        Direct loans and loan guarantees under this section shall be
      used to - 
          (A) acquire, improve, or rehabilitate intermodal or rail
        equipment or facilities, including track, components of track,
        bridges, yards, buildings, and shops;
          (B) refinance outstanding debt incurred for the purposes
        described in subparagraph (A); or
          (C) develop or establish new intermodal or railroad
        facilities.
      (2) Operating expenses not eligible
        Direct loans and loan guarantees under this section shall not
      be used for railroad operating expenses.
    (c) Priority projects
      In granting applications for direct loans or guaranteed loans
    under this section, the Secretary shall give priority to projects
    that - 
        (1) enhance public safety;
        (2) enhance the environment;
        (3) promote economic development;
        (4) enable United States companies to be more competitive in
      international markets;
        (5) are endorsed by the plans prepared under section 135 of
      title 23 by the State or States in which they are located;
        (6) preserve or enhance rail or intermodal service to small
      communities or rural areas;
        (7) enhance service and capacity in the national rail system;
      or
        (8) would materially alleviate rail capacity problems which
      degrade the provision of service to shippers and would fulfill a
      need in the national transportation system.
    (d) Extent of authority
      The aggregate unpaid principal amounts of obligations under
    direct loans and loan guarantees made under this section shall not
    exceed $35,000,000,000 at any one time. Of this amount, not less
    than $7,000,000,000 shall be available solely for projects
    primarily benefiting freight railroads other than Class I carriers.
    The Secretary shall not establish any limit on the proportion of
    the unused amount authorized under this subsection that may be used
    for 1 loan or loan guarantee.
    (e) Rates of interest
      (1) Direct loans
        The Secretary shall require interest to be paid on a direct
      loan made under this section at a rate not less than that
      necessary to recover the cost of making the loan.
      (2) Loan guarantees
        The Secretary shall not make a loan guarantee under this
      section if the interest rate for the loan exceeds that which the
      Secretary determines to be reasonable, taking into consideration
      the prevailing interest rates and customary fees incurred under
      similar obligations in the private capital market.
    (f) Infrastructure partners
      (1) Authority of Secretary
        In lieu of or in combination with appropriations of budget
      authority to cover the costs of direct loans and loan guarantees
      as required under section 661c(b)(1) of title 2, the Secretary
      may accept on behalf of an applicant for assistance under this
      section a commitment from a non-Federal source to fund in whole
      or in part credit risk premiums with respect to the loan that is
      the subject of the application. In no event shall the aggregate
      of appropriations of budget authority and credit risk premiums
      described in this paragraph with respect to a direct loan or loan
      guarantee be less than the cost of that direct loan or loan
      guarantee.
      (2) Credit risk premium amount
        The Secretary shall determine the amount required for credit
      risk premiums under this subsection on the basis of - 
          (A) the circumstances of the applicant, including the amount
        of collateral offered, if any;
          (B) the proposed schedule of loan disbursements;
          (C) historical data on the repayment history of similar
        borrowers;
          (D) consultation with the Congressional Budget Office;
          (E) the size and characteristics of the cohort of which the
        loan or loan guarantee is a member; and
          (F) any other factors the Secretary considers relevant.
      (3) Payment of premiums
        Credit risk premiums under this subsection shall be paid to the
      Secretary before the disbursement of loan amounts.
      (4) Cohorts of loans
        In order to maintain sufficient balances of credit risk
      premiums to adequately protect the Federal Government from risk
      of default, while minimizing the length of time the Government
      retains possession of those balances, the Secretary shall
      establish cohorts of loans. When all obligations attached to a
      cohort of loans have been satisfied, credit risk premiums paid
      for the cohort, and interest accrued thereon, which were not used
      to mitigate losses shall be returned to the original source on a
      pro rata basis. A cohort may include loans and loan guarantees.
      The Secretary shall not establish any limit on the proportion of
      a cohort that may be used for 1 loan or loan guarantee.
    (g) Prerequisites for assistance
      The Secretary shall not make a direct loan or loan guarantee
    under this section unless the Secretary has made a finding in
    writing that - 
        (1) repayment of the obligation is required to be made within a
      term of not more than 35 years from the date of its execution;
        (2) the direct loan or loan guarantee is justified by the
      present and probable future demand for rail services or
      intermodal facilities;
        (3) the applicant has given reasonable assurances that the
      facilities or equipment to be acquired, rehabilitated, improved,
      developed, or established with the proceeds of the obligation
      will be economically and efficiently utilized;
        (4) the obligation can reasonably be repaid, using an
      appropriate combination of credit risk premiums and collateral
      offered by the applicant to protect the Federal Government; and
        (5) the purposes of the direct loan or loan guarantee are
      consistent with subsection (b) of this section.
    (h) Conditions of assistance
      (1) The Secretary shall, before granting assistance under this
    section, require the applicant to agree to such terms and
    conditions as are sufficient, in the judgment of the Secretary, to
    ensure that, as long as any principal or interest is due and
    payable on such obligation, the applicant, and any railroad or
    railroad partner for whose benefit the assistance is intended - 
        (A) will not use any funds or assets from railroad or
      intermodal operations for purposes not related to such
      operations, if such use would impair the ability of the
      applicant, railroad, or railroad partner to provide rail or
      intermodal services in an efficient and economic manner, or would
      adversely affect the ability of the applicant, railroad, or
      railroad partner to perform any obligation entered into by the
      applicant under this section;
        (B) will, consistent with its capital resources, maintain its
      capital program, equipment, facilities, and operations on a
      continuing basis; and
        (C) will not make any discretionary dividend payments that
      unreasonably conflict with the purposes stated in subsection (b)
      of this section.

      (2) The Secretary shall not require an applicant for a direct
    loan or loan guarantee under this section to provide collateral.
    Any collateral provided or thereafter enhanced shall be valued as a
    going concern after giving effect to the present value of
    improvements contemplated by the completion and operation of the
    project. The Secretary shall not require that an applicant for a
    direct loan or loan guarantee under this section have previously
    sought the financial assistance requested from another source.
      (3) The Secretary shall require recipients of direct loans or
    loan guarantees under this section to comply with - 
        (A) the standards of section 24312 of title 49, as in effect on
      September 1, 2002, with respect to the project in the same manner
      that the National Railroad Passenger Corporation is required to
      comply with such standards for construction work financed under
      an agreement made under section 24308(a) of that title; and
        (B) the protective arrangements established under section 836
      of this title, with respect to employees affected by actions
      taken in connection with the project to be financed by the loan
      or loan guarantee.
    (i) Time limit for approval or disapproval
      Not later than 90 days after receiving a complete application for
    a direct loan or loan guarantee under this section, the Secretary
    shall approve or disapprove the application.
    (j) Repayment schedules
      (1) In general
        The Secretary shall establish a repayment schedule requiring
      payments to commence not later than the sixth anniversary date of
      the original loan disbursement.
      (2) Accrual
        Interest shall accrue as of the date of disbursement, and shall
      be amortized over the remaining term of the loan beginning at the
      time the payments begin.

-HEAD-
    Sec. 823. Administration of direct loans and loan guarantees

-STATUTE-
    (a) Applications
      The Secretary shall prescribe the form and contents required of
    applications for assistance under section 822 of this title, to
    enable the Secretary to determine the eligibility of the
    applicant's proposal, and shall establish terms and conditions for
    direct loans and loan guarantees made under that section.
    (b) (!1) Full faith and credit

      All guarantees entered into by the Secretary under section 822 of
    this title shall constitute general obligations of the United
    States of America backed by the full faith and credit of the United
    States of America.
    (b) (!1) Assignment of loan guarantees
      The holder of a loan guarantee made under section 822 of this
    title may assign the loan guarantee in whole or in part, subject to
    such requirements as the Secretary may prescribe.
    (c) Modifications
      The Secretary may approve the modification of any term or
    condition of a direct loan, loan guarantee, direct loan obligation,
    or loan guarantee commitment, including the rate of interest, time
    of payment of interest or principal, or security requirements, if
    the Secretary finds in writing that - 
        (1) the modification is equitable and is in the overall best
      interests of the United States; and
        (2) consent has been obtained from the applicant and, in the
      case of a loan guarantee or loan guarantee commitment, the holder
      of the obligation.
    (d) Compliance
      The Secretary shall assure compliance, by an applicant, any other
    party to the loan, and any railroad or railroad partner for whose
    benefit assistance is intended, with the provisions of this
    subchapter, regulations issued hereunder, and the terms and
    conditions of the direct loan or loan guarantee, including through
    regular periodic inspections.
    (e) Commercial validity
      For purposes of claims by any party other than the Secretary, a
    loan guarantee or loan guarantee commitment shall be conclusive
    evidence that the underlying obligation is in compliance with the
    provisions of this subchapter, and that such obligation has been
    approved and is legal as to principal, interest, and other terms.
    Such a guarantee or commitment shall be valid and incontestable in
    the hands of a holder thereof, including the original lender or any
    other holder, as of the date when the Secretary granted the
    application therefor, except as to fraud or material
    misrepresentation by such holder.
    (f) Default
      The Secretary shall prescribe regulations setting forth
    procedures in the event of default on a loan made or guaranteed
    under section 822 of this title. The Secretary shall ensure that
    each loan guarantee made under that section contains terms and
    conditions that provide that - 
        (1) if a payment of principal or interest under the loan is in
      default for more than 30 days, the Secretary shall pay to the
      holder of the obligation, or the holder's agent, the amount of
      unpaid guaranteed interest;
        (2) if the default has continued for more than 90 days, the
      Secretary shall pay to the holder of the obligation, or the
      holder's agent, 90 percent of the unpaid guaranteed principal;
        (3) after final resolution of the default, through liquidation
      or otherwise, the Secretary shall pay to the holder of the
      obligation, or the holder's agent, any remaining amounts
      guaranteed but which were not recovered through the default's
      resolution;
        (4) the Secretary shall not be required to make any payment
      under paragraphs (1) through (3) if the Secretary finds, before
      the expiration of the periods described in such paragraphs, that
      the default has been remedied; and
        (5) the holder of the obligation shall not receive payment or
      be entitled to retain payment in a total amount which, together
      with all other recoveries (including any recovery based upon a
      security interest in equipment or facilities) exceeds the actual
      loss of such holder.
    (g) Rights of the Secretary
      (1) Subrogation
        If the Secretary makes payment to a holder, or a holder's
      agent, under subsection (g) of this section in connection with a
      loan guarantee made under section 822 of this title, the
      Secretary shall be subrogated to all of the rights of the holder
      with respect to the obligor under the loan.
      (2) Disposition of property
        The Secretary may complete, recondition, reconstruct, renovate,
      repair, maintain, operate, charter, rent, sell, or otherwise
      dispose of any property or other interests obtained pursuant to
      this section. The Secretary shall not be subject to any Federal
      or State regulatory requirements when carrying out this
      paragraph.
    (h) Action against obligor
      The Secretary may bring a civil action in an appropriate Federal
    court in the name of the United States in the event of a default on
    a direct loan made under section 822 of this title, or in the name
    of the United States or of the holder of the obligation in the
    event of a default on a loan guaranteed under section 822 of this
    title. The holder of a guarantee shall make available to the
    Secretary all records and evidence necessary to prosecute the civil
    action. The Secretary may accept property in full or partial
    satisfaction of any sums owed as a result of a default. If the
    Secretary receives, through the sale or other disposition of such
    property, an amount greater than the aggregate of - 
        (1) the amount paid to the holder of a guarantee under
      subsection (g) of this section; and
        (2) any other cost to the United States of remedying the
      default,

    the Secretary shall pay such excess to the obligor.
    (i) Breach of conditions
      The Attorney General shall commence a civil action in an
    appropriate Federal court to enjoin any activity which the
    Secretary finds is in violation of this subchapter, regulations
    issued hereunder, or any conditions which were duly agreed to, and
    to secure any other appropriate relief.
    (j) Attachment
      No attachment or execution may be issued against the Secretary,
    or any property in the control of the Secretary, prior to the entry
    of final judgment to such effect in any State, Federal, or other
    court.
    (k) Evaluation charge
      The Secretary may charge and collect from each applicant a
    reasonable charge for the cost of evaluating the application,
    including appraisal of the value of the equipment or facilities for
    which the direct loan or loan guarantee is sought, and for making
    necessary determinations and findings. Such charge shall not
    aggregate more than one-half of 1 percent of the principal amount
    of the obligation. Amounts collected under this subsection shall be
    credited directly to the Safety and Operations account of the
    Federal Railroad Administration, and shall remain available until
    expended to pay for the evaluation costs described in this
    subsection.
    (l) Fees and charges
      Except as provided in this subchapter, the Secretary may not
    assess any fees, including user fees, or charges in connection with
    a direct loan or loan guarantee provided under section 822 of this
    title.

    Sec. 836. Employee protection

-STATUTE-
    (a) General
      Fair and equitable arrangements shall be provided, in accordance
    with this section, to protect the interests of any employees not
    otherwise protected under title V of the Regional Rail
    Reorganization Act of 1973 (45 U.S.C. 771 et seq.), who may be
    affected by actions taken pursuant to authorizations or approval
    obtained under this subchapter. Such arrangements shall be
    determined by the execution of an agreement between the
    representatives of the railroads and the representatives of their
    employees, within 120 days after February 5, 1976. In the absence
    of such an executed agreement, the Secretary of Labor shall
    prescribe the applicable protective arrangements, within 150 days
    after February 5, 1976.
    (b) Terms
      The arrangements required by subsection (a) of this section shall
    apply to each employee who has an employment relationship with a
    railroad on the date on which such railroad first applies for
    applicable financial assistance under this subchapter. Such
    arrangements shall include such provisions as may be necessary for
    the negotiation and execution of agreements as to the manner in
    which the protective arrangements shall be applied, including
    notice requirements. Such agreements shall be executed prior to
    implementation of work funded from financial assistance under this
    subchapter. If such an agreement is not reached within 30 days
    after the date on which an application for such assistance is
    approved, either party to the dispute may submit the issue for
    final and binding arbitration. The decision on any such arbitration
    shall be rendered within 30 days after such submission. Such
    arbitration decision shall in no way modify the protection afforded
    in the protective arrangements established pursuant to this
    section, shall be final and binding on the parties thereto, and
    shall become a part of the agreement. Such arrangements shall also
    include such provisions as may be necessary - 
        (1) for the preservation of compensation (including subsequent
      general wage increases, vacation allowances, and monthly
      compensation guarantees), rights, privileges, and benefits
      (including fringe benefits such as pensions, hospitalization, and
      vacations, under the same conditions and so long as such benefits
      continue to be accorded to other employees of the employing
      railroad in active service or on furlough, as the case may be) to
      such employees under existing collective-bargaining agreements or
      otherwise;
        (2) to provide for final and binding arbitration of any dispute
      which cannot be settled by the parties, with respect to the
      interpretation, application, or enforcement of the provisions of
      the protective arrangements;
        (3) to provide that an employee who is unable to secure
      employment by the exercise of his or her seniority rights, as a
      result of actions taken with financial assistance obtained under
      this subchapter, shall be offered reassignment and, where
      necessary, retraining to fill a position comparable to the
      position held at the time of such adverse effect and for which he
      is, or by training and retraining can become, physically and
      mentally qualified, so long as such offer is not in contravention
      of collective bargaining agreements relating thereto; and
        (4) to provide that the protection afforded pursuant to this
      section shall not be applicable to employees benefited solely as
      a result of the work which is financed by funds provided pursuant
      to this subchapter.
    (c) Subcontracting
      The arrangements which are required to be negotiated by the
    parties or prescribed by the Secretary of Labor, pursuant to
    subsections (a) and (b) of this section, shall include provisions
    regulating subcontracting by the railroads of work which is
    financed by funds provided pursuant to this subchapter.

-HEAD-
    Sec. 901. Congressional findings

-STATUTE-
      (a) Congress hereby finds that - 
        (1) the severe operating losses and the deteriorating plant and
      equipment of the Milwaukee Railroad threaten to cause cessation
      of its operations in the near future;
        (2) a cessation of operations by the Milwaukee Railroad would
      have serious repercussions on the economies of the States in
      which such railroad principally operates (the States of
      Washington, Montana, Idaho, North Dakota, South Dakota, Illinois,
      Iowa, Missouri, Michigan, Indiana, Minnesota, and Wisconsin);
        (3) a cessation of operations of the Milwaukee Railroad would
      result in the loss of many thousands of jobs of railroad workers
      and other workers whose employment is dependent upon rail service
      over the lines presently operated by the Milwaukee Railroad;
        (4) experienced railroad employees make a valuable contribution
      toward strengthening the railroad industry; and other railroads
      have the ability and willingness to employ displaced employees of
      the Milwaukee Railroad;
        (5) the ownership by employees or by employees and shippers of
      part or all of the Milwaukee Railroad may be a valuable tool in
      reorganization and should be given serious consideration;
        (6) cessation of essential transportation services by the
      Milwaukee Railroad would endanger the public welfare;
        (7) cessation of such services is imminent; and
        (8) there is no other practicable means of obtaining funds to
      meet payroll and other expenses necessary for continuation of
      services and reorganization of the Milwaukee Railroad.

      (b) The Congress declares that emergency measures set forth in
    this chapter must be taken to restructure the Milwaukee Railroad
    and to avoid the potential unemployment and damage to the economy
    of the region and of the Nation which a cessation of essential

    Stat. 2543, provided that: "It is the purpose of this subtitle
    [amending sections 915 and 1017 of this title and enacting
    provisions set out as notes under this section] to continue the
    effort by Congress to assure service over the lines of rail

    responsible persons are willing to purchase the lines for continued
    rail operations."

        "(1) it is necessary to establish procedures to facilitate and
      expedite the acquisition of rail lines of carriers subject to
      liquidation by financially responsible persons in instances where
      service is not being provided over the line by the carrier and
      where the financially responsible person seeks to provide rail
      service over the line;
        "(2) procedures set forth in the amendments made by this title
      [see Short Title of 1983 Amendment note above] represent an
      exercise of the powers of the Congress under the Constitution to
      regulate commerce among the several States which will provide a
      practicable means for preserving rail service, thus benefiting
      shippers, employees, and the economies of the States in which
      such carriers subject to liquidation have operated service, and
      for facilitating interstate commerce, while at the same time
      providing safeguards to protect the interest of the estates of
      such carriers by requiring compensation which is not less than
      the constitutionally required minimum; and
        "(3) it is in the public interest that the Interstate Commerce
      Commission's authority to issue orders involving temporary
      authority to operate service over lines of carriers subject to
      liquidation be clarified."

    Sec. 904. Court approved abandonments and sales

-STATUTE-
    (a) Abandonment of lines of railroad under section 1170 of title 11
      (1) Upon the occurrence of an event described in section 920(b)
    of this title, or on April 1, 1980, whichever first occurs, the
    bankruptcy court may authorize the abandonment of lines of the
    Milwaukee Railroad pursuant to section 1170 of title 11. Pending
    the expiration of the time for appeal of an abandonment order or
    the determination of any such appeal, the bankruptcy court may
    authorize the termination of service on a line to be abandoned, and
    the order authorizing such termination may not be stayed. In
    authorizing any abandonment pursuant to this section, the court
    shall require the carrier to provide a fair arrangement at least as
    protective of the interests of employees as that required under
    section 11347 (!1) of title 49.

      (2) Prior to the date specified in paragraph (1) of this
    subsection, the bankruptcy court may hear and consider any request
    for the abandonment of lines of the Milwaukee Railroad, and may fix
    the time for the Commission's report on the request, but it may
    take final action authorizing such abandonment only in accordance
    with such paragraph (1).
    (b) Sale or transfer of lines of railroad
      (1) Upon the occurrence of an event described in section 920(b)
    of this title, or on April 1, 1980, whichever first occurs, the
    bankruptcy court may authorize the sale or transfer of a line of
    the Milwaukee Railroad to be used in continued rail operations,
    subject to the approval of the Commission under paragraph (2) of
    this subsection. In authorizing any such sale or transfer, the
    court shall provide a fair arrangement at least as protective of
    the interest (!2) of employees as that required under section 11347
    (!1) of title 49.

      (2) The bankruptcy court may not authorize a sale or transfer
    pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subsection unless an appropriate
    application with respect to such sale or transfer is initiated with
    the Commission and, within such time as the court may fix, not
    exceeding 180 days, the Commission, with or without a hearing, as
    the Commission may determine, and with or without modification or
    condition, approves such application, or does not act on such
    application. Any action or order of the Commission approving,
    modifying, conditioning, or disapproving such application is
    subject to review by the court only under sections 706(2)(A),
    706(2)(B), 706(2)(C), and 706(2)(D) of title 5. An application may
    be initiated with the Commission prior to the date specified in
    paragraph (1) of this subsection.
      (3) Pending review of an application by the Commission pursuant
    to paragraph (2) of this subsection, the bankruptcy court may, on a
    preliminary basis, authorize the sale or transfer of lines of the
    Milwaukee Railroad to another rail carrier. The court may permit
    the purchasing carrier to operate interim service as a common
    carrier over the lines to be purchased, without regard to section
    10901 of title 49. In operating such service, the purchasing
    carrier shall use employees of the Milwaukee Railroad to the extent
    necessary for the operation of such service. The bankruptcy court
    may take final action authorizing any such sale or transfer only in
    accordance with paragraph (1) of this subsection.
    (c) Effect on priorities and timing of employee protection payments
      Nothing in this section shall be deemed to affect the priorities
    or timing of payment of employee protection which might have
    existed in the absence of this chapter.

    Sec. 905. Employee or employee-shipper ownership plan

-STATUTE-
    (a) Submission of plan to Commission; approval; findings
      (1) No later than December 1, 1979, an association composed of
    representatives of national railway labor organizations, employee
    coalitions, and shippers (or any combination of the foregoing) may
    submit to the Commission a single plan for converting all or a
    substantial part of the Milwaukee Railroad into an employee or
    employee-shipper owned company and a method for implementing such
    plan. The plan shall include a comprehensive evaluation of the
    prospects for the financial self-sustainability of the Milwaukee
    Railroad.
      (2) The Commission shall, within 30 days after the date of
    submission of a plan under paragraph (1) of this subsection,
    approve the proposed plan if it finds that such plan is feasible.
    The finding of the Commission with respect to the feasibility of
    the plan shall be made pursuant to section 554 of title 5.
      (3) The Commission shall make a finding that the plan submitted
    under this section is feasible if it determines that - 
        (A) adequate public and private financing is available to the
      proponents of such plan;
        (B) such plan is fair and equitable to the estate of the
      Milwaukee Railroad;
        (C) implementation of such plan will occur by April 1, 1980;
        (D) the railroad proposed to be operated under the plan can be
      operated on a self-sustaining basis; and
        (E) the plan contains an assessment of all operating practices,
      and includes agreements by labor and management to make
      implementing changes designed to achieve labor productivity
      increases (which may include changes in work rules to increase
      productivity) consistent with safe operations and adequate
      service.

    For purposes of the determinations under this paragraph, adequate
    financing shall include all sources of private funds, the probable
    value and priority of valid claims against the estate, and Federal,
    State, or local funds available under programs (in existence as of
    January 1, 1980) which are or will be available to the proponent
    and which the proponent is likely to obtain.
    (b) Submission of findings to bankruptcy court
      If the Commission finds that the plan submitted under this
    section is feasible, it shall submit its finding to the bankruptcy
    court. Within 10 days after the date of such submission, the
    bankruptcy court shall, after a hearing, determine whether such
    plan is fair and equitable to the estate of the Milwaukee Railroad.
    The Commission's determination with respect to that issue shall be
    rebutted only by clear and convincing evidence.
    (c) Implementation of plan
      If the Commission finds that the plan is feasible and the
    bankruptcy court determines that the plan is fair and equitable to
    the estate of the Milwaukee Railroad, the proponents of such plan
    shall implement the plan no later than April 1, 1980.
    (d) Judicial review
      Except as provided in this section, the findings of the
    Commission with respect to the plan shall not be subject to review.
    (e) Furnishing of reports and other information for preparation of
      plan
      (1) The trustee of the Milwaukee Railroad shall promptly provide
    to the person engaged in developing the employee or employee and
    shipper ownership plan under this section - 
        (A) its most recent reports on the physical condition of the
      railroad; and
        (B) traffic, revenue, marketing, and other data necessary to
      determine the amount of the acquisition cost of the railroad or
      portion of the railroad that would be required to continue rail
      transportation over the railroad line.

      (2) Information provided pursuant to this subsection shall be
    used only for purposes of preparing a plan and shall not be
    disclosed to any competitor or, unless necessary in connection with
    the preparation of the plan, to any customer of the Milwaukee
    Railroad.

      The Secretary of Transportation shall, under the authority of the
    Emergency Rail Services Act of 1970 [45 U.S.C. 661 et seq.],
    immediately guarantee trustee certificates of the Milwaukee

    Milwaukee Railroad continues for the 60-day period beginning on the
    date of the occurrence of an event described in section 920(b) of
    this title or on April 1, 1980, whichever first occurs. Such
    guarantee shall be made without regard to the findings set forth in
    section 3(a) of the Emergency Rail Services Act of 1970 [45 U.S.C.
    662(a)], and the provisions of section 3(b)(3) [45 U.S.C.

    (e) Amount of guarantee
      The Secretary shall guarantee trustee certificates of the
    Milwaukee Railroad pursuant to this section in an amount equal to
    the difference between (1) the total expenses incurred by such
    railroad attributable to the maintenance and the continuation of
    service in accordance with subsection (d) of this section, and (2)

    of Transportation the sum of $10,000,000, out of funds available
    for directed service under title 49. The Secretary of
    Transportation shall immediately make such funds available to the
    trustee of the Milwaukee Railroad for purposes of financing the
    operations of the Milwaukee Railroad, beginning November 1, 1979,
    in accordance with section 920 of this title.
    (h) Cancellation of United States obligations
      (1) All obligations to the United States or any agency or

    TITLE 45 - RAILROADS
    CHAPTER 18 - MILWAUKEE RAILROAD RESTRUCTURING

-HEAD-
    Sec. 915. Court approved abandonment and sales in pending cases

-STATUTE-
    (a) Abandonment of lines of railroad under Bankruptcy Act
      Notwithstanding any other provision of law, in any case pending
    under section 77 of the Bankruptcy Act on November 4, 1979, the
    court may authorize the abandonment of lines of railroad pursuant
    to section 1170 of title 11. Pending the expiration of the time for
    appeal of an abandonment order or the determination of any such
    appeal, the court may authorize the termination of service on a
    line to be abandoned, and the order authorizing such termination
    may not be stayed. In authorizing any abandonment pursuant to this
    section, the court shall require the carrier to provide a fair
    arrangement at least as protective of the interests of employees as
    that required under section 11347 (!1) of title 49.

    (b) Sale or transfer of lines of railroad under Bankruptcy Act
      (1) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, in any case
    pending under section 77 of the Bankruptcy Act on November 4, 1979,
    the court may authorize the sale or transfer of a line of railroad
    to be used in continued rail operations, subject to the approval of
    the Commission under paragraph (2) of this subsection, if the
    application with respect to such sale or transfer is filed with the
    Commission on or after November 1, 1979. In authorizing any such
    sale or transfer, the court shall provide a fair arrangement at
    least as protective of the interests of employees as that required
    under section 11347 (!1) of title 49.
      (2) The court described in paragraph (1) may not authorize a sale
    or transfer pursuant to such paragraph unless an appropriate
    application with respect to such sale or transfer is initiated with
    the Commission and, within such time as the court may fix, not
    exceeding 180 days, the Commission, with or without a hearing, as
    the Commission may determine, and with or without modification or
    condition, approves such application, or does not act on such
    application. Any action or order of the Commission approving,
    modifying, conditioning, or disapproving such application is
    subject to review by the court only under sections 706(2)(A),
    706(2)(B), 706(2)(C), and 706(2)(D) of title 5.
      (3)(A) If a person has made or makes an offer to acquire from a
    carrier subject to liquidation a rail line or lines over which no
    service is provided by that carrier, and that offer has been or is
    rejected by the trustee in bankruptcy of such carrier, such person
    may submit an application to the Commission seeking approval of
    such person's acquisition of such line or lines. A copy of any such
    application shall be filed simultaneously with the court.
      (B) The Commission shall, within 15 days after the filing of an
    application under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph, determine
    whether the applicant - 
        (i) is a financially responsible person; and
        (ii) has made a bona fide offer to acquire the line or lines
      under reasonable terms.

      (C)(i) If the Commission's determination under subparagraph (B)
    of this paragraph is affirmative with respect to the matters
    referred to in clauses (i) and (ii) of such subparagraph, the
    applicant and the trustee in bankruptcy (hereafter in this
    paragraph referred to collectively as the "parties") shall enter
    into negotiations with respect to terms for the acquisition of the
    line or lines applied for. If the parties at any time agree on such
    terms, a request for approval of the acquisition shall be filed
    with the Commission and the court. If the parties are unable to
    agree to such terms within 30 days after the date of the
    Commission's determination under subparagraph (B) of this
    paragraph, either party may, within 60 days after the expiration of
    such 30-day period, request the Commission to prescribe terms for
    such acquisition, including compensation for the line or lines to
    be acquired. The Commission shall prescribe such terms within 60
    days after any such request is made. The terms prescribed by the
    Commission shall be binding upon both parties, subject to court
    review as provided in subparagraph (D) of this paragraph, except
    that the applicant may withdraw its offer within 10 days after the
    Commission prescribes such terms.
      (ii) If more than one applicant has requested under this
    subparagraph that the Commission prescribe the terms of acquisition
    for the same or overlapping lines or portions of such lines, the
    Commission shall prescribe terms for such acquisition which it
    determines best serve the public interest.
      (D)(i) Within 15 days after the Commission prescribes terms under
    subparagraph (C) of this paragraph, the Commission shall transmit
    such terms to the court, unless the offer is withdrawn under such
    subparagraph. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the court
    shall, within 60 days after such transmittal, approve the
    acquisition under terms prescribed by the Commission if the
    compensation for the line or lines is not less than that required
    as a constitutional minimum.
      (ii) Except as provided in this subparagraph, no action shall be
    taken by the court which would prejudice the acquisition which is
    the subject of an application under this paragraph.
      (E) The Commission shall require that any person acquiring a line
    or lines under this paragraph use, to the maximum extent
    practicable, employees or former employees of the carrier subject
    to liquidation in the operation of service on such line or lines.
      (F) No person acquiring a line under this paragraph may transfer
    or discontinue service on such line prior to the expiration of 4
    years after such acquisition.
      (G) The Commission shall, within 45 days after January 14, 1983,
    prescribe such regulations and procedures as are necessary to carry
    out the provisions of this paragraph.
      (H) As used in this paragraph, the term - 
        (i) "carrier subject to liquidation" means a carrier which, on
      January 14, 1983, was the subject of a proceeding pending under
      section 77 of the Bankruptcy Act or under subchapter IV of
      chapter 11 of title 11 and which has been ordered by the court to
      liquidate its properties;
        (ii) "the court" means the court having bankruptcy jurisdiction
      over the carrier subject to liquidation; and
        (iii) "financially responsible person" means a person capable
      of compensating the carrier subject to liquidation for the
      acquisition of the line or lines proposed to be acquired and able
      to cover expenses associated with providing service over such
      line or lines for a period of not less than 4 years.

      (4) Pending review of an application by the Commission pursuant
    to paragraph (2) of this subsection, the court described in
    paragraph (1) may, on a preliminary basis, authorize the sale or
    transfer proposed in such application. The court may permit the
    purchasing carrier to operate interim service over the lines to be
    purchased, and in operating such service it shall use employees of
    the carrier subject to the bankruptcy proceeding to the extent such
    purchasing carrier deems necessary for the operation of such
    service.
    (c) Judicial review
      Any action or order of the Commission approving, modifying,
    conditioning, or disapproving an application for the sale or
    transfer of rail property that is filed with the Commission before
    November 1, 1979, in connection with a case pending under section
    77 of the Bankruptcy Act on November 4, 1979 - 
        (1) is subject to review by the court only under sections
      706(2)(A), 706(2)(B), 706(2)(C), and 706(2)(D) of title 5; and
        (2) may not be stayed by the Commission.
    (d) Authority of bankruptcy court
      The authority of the bankruptcy court to authorize abandonments,
    sales, and transfers of lines of the Milwaukee Railroad shall be
    governed by the provisions of section 904 of this title, rather
    than the provisions of this section.
    (e) Effect on priorities and timing of employee protection payments
      Nothing in this section shall be deemed to affect the priorities
    or timing of payment of employee protection which might have
    existed in the absence of this chapter.

    Sec. 1001. Congressional findings

-STATUTE-
      Congress hereby finds that - 
        (1) uninterrupted continuation of services over Rock Island
      lines is dependent on adequate employee protection provisions
      covering Rock Island Railroad employees who are not hired by
      other railroads;
        (2) for those Rock Island Railroad employees not hired by other
      rail carriers, there is no other practicable means of obtaining
      funds to meet the necessary costs of such employee protection
      that are assumed by the Rock Island Railroad;
        (3) a cessation of necessary operations of the Rock Island
      Railroad would have serious repercussions on the economies of the
      States in which such railroad principally operates; and
        (4) premature cessation of services over lines which are the
      subject of pending purchase application would result in harm to
      the shipping public and could imperil continuation of vital
      commuter service.

-STATUTE-
    (a) Situations requiring directed service; time period
      Notwithstanding the provisions of Public Law 96-131, the
    Commission shall order directed service for a period of not to
    exceed 90 days over any line of the Rock Island Railroad if the
    Secretary finds and certifies to the Commission that - 
        (1) a lack of rail service exists which cannot be resolved by a
      grant of interim operating authority over such line and grains or
      foods are ready to be shipped to market; or
        (2) a lack of rail service exists which cannot be resolved by a
      grant of interim operating authority over such line and a rail
      carrier, shipper, State, or other interested party has expressed
      in writing to the Secretary an interest in purchasing, leasing,
      or rehabilitating the particular rail line or facility for
      purposes of providing rail services, and there is a reasonable
      expectation that such transaction will be consummated.
    (b) Availability of funds
      (1) Not more than $15,000,000 of the funds available for
    expenditure by the Secretary out of the Railroad Rehabilitation and
    Improvement Fund established under title V of the Railroad
    Revitalization and Regulatory Reform Act of 1976 (45 U.S.C. 821 et
    seq.) may be made available by the Secretary to the Commission for
    purposes of providing directed service under this section and
    section 916(b) (!1) of this title.

      (2) Funds may be made available for directed service under this
    section without regard to the findings of the Secretary required
    under title V of the Railroad Revitalization and Regulatory Reform
    Act of 1976 [45 U.S.C. 821 et seq.], and section 516 of such Act
    (45 U.S.C. 836) shall not apply to any directed service provided
    with such funds.
    (c) Continuation of compensation terms for trackage rights, joint
      facilities, etc.
      The terms of compensation for all trackage rights, joint
    facilities, and similar arrangements between other rail carriers
    and the trustee of the Rock Island Railroad which are in effect on
    or after March 15, 1980, on portions of the lines of the Rock
    Island Railroad involved in temporary emergency operations shall be
    continued in effect during the duration of the temporary emergency
    operating authority with the carrier providing temporary emergency
    service substituting for the trustee, except where the Rock Island
    Railroad has been given more favorable treatment by virtue of its
    bankruptcy. Such continuation shall not alter or affect the
    ultimate rights of other rail carriers under trackage rights, joint
    facilities, or similar arrangements nor prejudice the ultimate
    determination of any controversy or proceeding concerning rights of
    the parties with regard to assignment by the trustee of rights in
    or to the facilities or under the arrangements.

    or facility of the Rock Island Railroad which has been approved for
    abandonment by the Commission or the bankruptcy court may be

    the Secretary approve a disposition of such portion of the rail
    line or related facility to any carrier or other entity not engaged
    in providing railroad services or not formed for the purpose of
    providing railroad services. The Secretary, upon application by the
    Rock Island Railroad, shall grant such approval unless he finds
    that - 
        (1) a rail carrier, shipper, State, or other interested party
      has expressed in writing an interest in purchasing, leasing or

    under such terms of compensation as the carriers establish between
    themselves, or if the carriers are unable to agree, under such
    terms of compensation as the Commission finds to be reasonable. The
    Commission shall have authority to authorize continued rail service
    under this section over the lines of any such carrier which has
    been ordered by the court having jurisdiction over such a carrier
    to liquidate its properties until the disposition of the properties

-HEAD-
    Sec. 1101. Congressional findings and declarations

-STATUTE-
      The Congress finds and declares that - 
        (1) the processes set in motion by the Regional Rail
      Reorganization Act of 1973 [45 U.S.C. 701 et seq.] have failed to
      create a self-sustaining railroad system in the Northeast region
      of the United States and have cost United States taxpayers many
      billions of dollars over original estimates;
        (2) current arrangements for the provision of rail freight and
      commuter service in the Northeast and Midwest regions of the
      United States are inadequate to meet the transportation needs of
      the public and the needs of national security;
        (3) although the Federal Government has provided billions of
      dollars in assistance for Conrail and its employees, the Federal
      interest in ensuring the flow of interstate commerce through rail
      service in the private sector has not been achieved, and the
      protection of interstate commerce requires Federal intervention
      to preserve essential rail service in the private sector;
        (4) the provisions for protection of employees of bankrupt
      railroads contained in the Regional Rail Reorganization Act of
      1973 [45 U.S.C. 701 et seq.] have resulted in the payment of
      benefits far in excess of levels anticipated at the time of
      enactment, have imposed an excessive fiscal burden on the Federal
      taxpayer, and are now an obstacle to the establishment of
      improved rail service and continued rail employment in the
      Northeast region of the United States; and
        (5) since holding Conrail liable for employee protection
      payments would destroy its prospects of becoming a profitable
      carrier and further injure its employees, an alternative employee
      protection system must be developed and funded.

    CHAPTER 20 - NORTHEAST RAIL SERVICE

-HEAD-
    Sec. 1103. Goals and objectives

-STATUTE-
      It is the goal of this subtitle to provide Conrail the
    opportunity to become profitable through the achievement of the
    following objectives:
      (1) Nonagreement personnel
        (A) Employees who are not subject to collective bargaining
      agreements (hereafter in this section referred to as
      "nonagreement personnel") should forego wage increases and
      benefits in an amount proportionately equivalent to the amount
      foregone by agreement employees pursuant to paragraph (4) of this
      section, adjusted annually to reflect inflation.
        (B) After May 1, 1981, the number of nonagreement personnel
      should be reduced proportionately to any reduction in agreement
      employees (excluding reductions pursuant to the termination
      program under section 797a of this title).
      (2) Suppliers
        To facilitate the orderly movement of goods in interstate
      commerce, materials and services should continue to be available
      to Conrail, under normal business practices, including the
      provision of credit and normal financing arrangements.
      (3) Shippers
        Conrail should utilize the revenue opportunities available to
      it under the Staggers Rail Act of 1980 and subtitle IV of title
      49.
      (4) Agreement employees
        (A) Conrail should enter into collective bargaining agreements
      with its employees which would reduce Conrail's costs in an
      amount equal to $200,000,000 a year, beginning April 1, 1981,
      adjusted annually to reflect inflation.
        (B) Agreements under this subparagraph may provide for
      reductions in wage increases and for changes in fringe benefits
      common to agreement employees, including vacations and holidays.
        (C) The cost reductions required under this subparagraph in the
      first year of the agreement may be deferred, but the aggregate
      cost reductions should be no less than an average of $200,000,000
      per year for each of the first three one-year periods beginning
      April 1, 1981.
        (D) The amount of cost reductions provided under this paragraph
      shall be calculated by subtracting the cost of an agreement
      entered into under this paragraph from (i) the cost that would
      otherwise result from the application of the national agreement
      reached by railroad industry and its employees, or (ii) until
      such national agreement is reached, the cost which the United
      States Railway Association estimates would result from the
      application of such a national agreement.

-STATUTE-
    (a) Final decisions involving railroads in bankruptcy
      Notwithstanding any other provision of subtitle IV of title 49,
    in any proceeding before the Commission under section 11324 or
    11325 of title 49 involving a railroad in the Region, as defined in
    section 702 of this title, which was in a bankruptcy proceeding
    under section 77 of the Bankruptcy Act on November 4, 1979, the
    Commission shall, with or without a hearing, issue a final decision
    within a period not to exceed 180 days after receipt of an
    application under either such section.
    (b) Final decisions involving profitable railroads
      Notwithstanding any other provision of subtitle IV of title 49,
    in any proceeding before the Commission under section 11324 or
    11325 of title 49 involving a profitable railroad in the Region, as
    defined in section 702 of this title, which received a loan under
    section 721(a) of this title, the Commission shall, with or without
    a hearing, issue a final decision within a period not to exceed 180
    days after receipt of an application under either such section.
    (c) Interest of United States attaching in bankruptcy, liquidation,
      abandonment, etc.
      (1) If the Secretary determines under subsection (b) of this
    section that there is an agreement between a profitable railroad in
    the Region (as defined in section 702 of this title) which received
    a loan under section 721(a) of this title and a prospective
    purchaser for the sale of such railroad, the Secretary shall limit
    the interest of the United States in any debt of such a railroad to
    an interest which attaches to such debt in the event of bankruptcy
    or substantial sale or liquidation of the assets of the railroad.
    The Secretary may substitute for the evidence of such debt
    contingency notes payable solely from the railroad operating assets
    then securing such debt, including reinvestments thereof, or such
    other contingency notes as the Secretary deems appropriate and
    which conform to the terms set forth in this subsection.
      (2) If the interest of the United States is limited under
    paragraph (1), any new debt issued by such a railroad subsequent to
    the issuance of the debt described in paragraph (1) may have such
    higher priority in the event of bankruptcy, liquidation, or
    abandonment of the assets of such a railroad than the debt
    described in such paragraph as the Secretary and the railroad may
    agree.
      (3) In carrying out the duties under this subsection, the
    Secretary may (A) enter into such agreements, (B) in accordance
    with any such agreements, cancel or cause to be cancelled or amend
    or cause to be amended any notes or securities currently held by
    agencies or instrumentalities of the United States, and (C) accept
    in exchange as substitution therefor such instruments evidencing
    the indebtedness owed to such agencies or instrumentalities as, in
    the Secretary's judgment, will effectuate the purposes of this
    subsection.

-HEAD-
    Sec. 1201. Findings

-STATUTE-
      The Congress finds that - 
        (1) the Alaska Railroad, which was built by the Federal
      Government to serve the transportation and development needs of
      the Territory of Alaska, presently is providing freight and
      passenger services that primarily benefit residents and
      businesses in the State of Alaska;
        (2) many communities and individuals in Alaska are wholly or
      substantially dependent on the Alaska Railroad for freight and
      passenger service and provision of such service is an essential
      governmental function;
        (3) continuation of services of the Alaska Railroad and the
      opportunity for future expansion of those services are necessary
      to achieve Federal, State, and private objectives; however,
      continued Federal control and financial support are no longer
      necessary to accomplish these objectives;
        (4) the transfer of the Alaska Railroad and provision for its
      operation by the State in the manner contemplated by this chapter
      is made pursuant to the Federal goal and ongoing program of
      transferring appropriate activities to the States;
        (5) the State's continued operation of the Alaska Railroad
      following the transfer contemplated by this chapter, together
      with such expansion of the railroad as may be necessary or
      convenient in the future, will constitute an appropriate public
      use of the rail system and associated properties, will provide an
      essential governmental service, and will promote the general
      welfare of Alaska's residents and visitors; and
        (6) in order to give the State government the ability to
      determine the Alaska Railroad's role in serving the State's
      transportation needs in the future, including the opportunity to
      extend rail service, and to provide a savings to the Federal
      Government, the Federal Government should offer to transfer the
      railroad to the State, in accordance with the provisions of this
      chapter, in the same manner in which other Federal transportation
      functions (including highways and airports) have been transferred
      since Alaska became a State in 1959.

    TITLE 45 - RAILROADS
    CHAPTER 21 - ALASKA RAILROAD TRANSFER

-HEAD-
    Sec. 1203. Transfer authorization

-STATUTE-
    (a) Authority of Secretary; time, manner, etc., of transfer
      Subject to the provisions of this chapter, the United States,
    through the Secretary, shall transfer all rail properties of the
    Alaska Railroad to the State. Such transfer shall occur as soon as
    practicable after the Secretary has made the certifications
    required by subsection (d) of this section and shall be
    accomplished in the manner specified in subsection (b) of this
    section.
    (b) Simultaneous and interim transfers, conveyances, etc.
      (1) On the date of transfer, the Secretary shall simultaneously:
        (A) deliver to the State a bill of sale conveying title to all
      rail properties of the Alaska Railroad except any interest in
      real property;
        (B) deliver to the State an interim conveyance of the rail
      properties of the Alaska Railroad that are not conveyed pursuant
      to subparagraph (A) of this paragraph and are not subject to
      unresolved claims of valid existing rights;
        (C) deliver to the State an exclusive license granting the
      State the right to use all rail properties of the Alaska Railroad
      not conveyed pursuant to subparagraphs (A) or (B) of this
      paragraph pending conveyances in accordance with the review and
      settlement or final administrative adjudication of claims of
      valid existing rights;
        (D) convey to the State a deed granting the State (i) an
      exclusive-use easement for that portion of the right-of-way of
      the Alaska Railroad within the Denali National Park and Preserve
      extending not less than one hundred feet on either side of the
      main or branch line tracks, and eight feet on either side of the
      centerline of the "Y" track connecting the main line of the
      railroad to the power station at McKinley Park Station and (ii)
      title to railroad-related improvements within such right-of-way.

    Prior to taking the action specified in subparagraphs (A) through
    (D) of this paragraph, the Secretary shall consult with the
    Secretary of the Interior. The exclusive-use easement granted
    pursuant to subparagraph (D) of this paragraph and all rights
    afforded by such easement shall be exercised only for railroad
    purposes, and for such other transportation, transmission, or
    communication purposes for which lands subject to such easement
    were utilized as of January 14, 1983.
      (2) The Secretary shall deliver to the State an interim
    conveyance of rail properties of the Alaska Railroad described in
    paragraph (1)(C) of this subsection that become available for
    conveyance to the State after the date of transfer as a result of
    settlement, relinquishment, or final administrative adjudication
    pursuant to section 1205 of this title. Where the rail properties
    to be conveyed pursuant to this paragraph are surveyed at the time
    they become available for conveyance to the State, the Secretary
    shall deliver a patent therefor in lieu of an interim conveyance.
      (3) The force and effect of an interim conveyance made pursuant
    to paragraphs (1)(B) or (2) of this subsection shall be to convey
    to and vest in the State exactly the same right, title, and
    interest in and to the rail properties identified therein as the
    State would have received had it been issued a patent by the United
    States. The Secretary of the Interior shall survey the land
    conveyed by an interim conveyance to the State pursuant to
    paragraphs (1)(B) or (2) of this subsection and, upon completion of
    the survey, the Secretary shall issue a patent therefor.
      (4) The license granted pursuant to paragraph (1)(C) of this
    subsection shall authorize the State to use, occupy, and directly
    receive all benefits of the rail properties described in the
    license for the operation of the State-owned railroad in conformity
    with the Memorandum of Understanding referred to in section
    1205(b)(3) of this title. The license shall be exclusive, subject
    only to valid leases, permits, and other instruments issued before
    the date of transfer and easements reserved pursuant to subsection
    (c)(2) of this section. With respect to any parcel conveyed
    pursuant to this chapter, the license shall terminate upon
    conveyance of such parcel.
    (c) Reservations to United States in interim conveyances and
      patents
      (1) Interim conveyances and patents issued to the State pursuant
    to subsection (b) of this section shall confirm, convey and vest in
    the State all reservations to the United States (whether or not
    expressed in a particular patent or document of title), except the
    unexercised reservations to the United States for future rights-of-
    way made or required by the first section of the Act of March 12,
    1914 (43 U.S.C. 975d). The conveyance to the State of such
    reservations shall not be affected by the repeal of such Act under
    section 615 of this title.(!1)

      (2) In the license granted under subsection (b)(1)(C) of this
    section and in all conveyances made to the State under this
    chapter, there shall be reserved to the Secretary of the Interior,
    the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Agriculture, as
    appropriate, existing easements for administration (including
    agency transportation and utility purposes) that are identified in
    the report required by section 1204(a) of this title. The
    appropriate Secretary may obtain, only after consent of the State,
    such future easements as are necessary for administration. Existing
    and future easements and use of such easements shall not interfere
    with operations and support functions of the State-owned railroad.
      (3) There shall be reserved to the Secretary of the Interior the
    right to use and occupy, without compensation, five thousand square
    feet of land at Talkeetna, Alaska, as described in ARR lease
    numbered 69-25-0003-5165 for National Park Service administrative
    activities, so long as the use or occupation does not interfere
    with the operation of the State-owned railroad. This reservation
    shall be effective on the date of transfer under this section or
    the expiration date of such lease, whichever is later.
    (d) Certifications by Secretary; scope, subject matter, etc.
      (1) Prior to the date of transfer, the Secretary shall certify
    that the State has agreed to operate the railroad as a rail carrier
    in intrastate and interstate commerce.
      (2)(A) Prior to the date of transfer, the Secretary shall also
    certify that the State has agreed to assume all rights,
    liabilities, and obligations of the Alaska Railroad on the date of
    transfer, including leases, permits, licenses, contracts,
    agreements, claims, tariffs, accounts receivable, and accounts
    payable, except as otherwise provided by this chapter.
      (B) Notwithstanding the provisions of subparagraph (A) of this
    paragraph, the United States shall be solely responsible for - 
        (i) all claims and causes of action against the Alaska Railroad
      that accrue on or before the date of transfer, regardless of the
      date on which legal proceedings asserting such claims were or may
      be filed, except that the United States shall, in the case of any
      tort claim, only be responsible for any such claim against the
      United States that accrues before the date of transfer and
      results in an award, compromise, or settlement of more than
      $2,500, and the United States shall not compromise or settle any
      claim resulting in State liability without the consent of the
      State, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld; and
        (ii) all claims that resulted in a judgment or award against
      the Alaska Railroad before the date of transfer.

      (C) For purposes of subparagraph (B) of this paragraph, the term
    "accrue" shall have the meaning contained in section 2401 of title
    28.
      (D) Any hazardous substance, petroleum or other contaminant
    release at or from the State-owned rail properties that began prior
    to January 5, 1985, shall be and remain the liability of the United
    States for damages and for the costs of investigation and cleanup.
    Such liability shall be enforceable under 42 U.S.C. 9601 et
    seq.(!1) for any release described in the preceding sentence.
      (3)(A) Prior to the date of transfer, the Secretary shall also
    certify that the State-owned railroad has established arrangements
    pursuant to section 1206 of this title to protect the employment
    interests of employees of the Alaska Railroad during the two-year
    period commencing on the date of transfer. These arrangements shall
    include provisions - 
        (i) which ensure that the State-owned railroad will adopt
      collective bargaining agreements in accordance with the
      provisions of subparagraph (B) of this paragraph;
        (ii) for the retention of all employees, other than officers of
      the Alaska Railroad, who elect to transfer to the State-owned
      railroad in their same positions for the two-year period
      commencing on the date of transfer, except in cases of
      reassignment, separation for cause, resignation, retirement, or
      lack of work;
        (iii) for the payment of compensation to transferred employees
      (other than employees provided for in subparagraph (E) of this
      paragraph), except in cases of separation for cause, resignation,
      retirement, or lack of work, for two years commencing on the date
      of transfer at or above the base salary levels in effect for such
      employees on the date of transfer, unless the parties otherwise
      agree during that two-year period;
        (iv) for priority of reemployment at the State-owned railroad
      during the two-year period commencing on the date of transfer for
      transferred employees who are separated for lack of work, in
      accordance with subparagraph (C) of this paragraph (except for
      officers of the Alaska Railroad, who shall receive such priority
      for one year following the date of transfer);
        (v) for credit during the two-year period commencing on the
      date of transfer for accrued annual and sick leave, seniority
      rights, and relocation and turnaround travel allowances which
      have been accrued during their period of Federal employment by
      transfered (!2) employees retained by the State-owned railroad
      (except for officers of the Alaska Railroad, who shall receive
      such credit for one year following the date of transfer);

        (vi) for payment to transferred employees retained by the State-
      owned railroad during the two-year period commencing on the date
      of transfer, including for one year officers retained or
      separated under subparagraph (E) of this paragraph, of an amount
      equivalent to the cost-of-living allowance to which they are

      transfer, in accordance with the provisions of subparagraph (D)
      of this paragraph; and
        (vii) for health and life insurance programs for transferred
      employees retained by the State-owned railroad during the two-
      year period commencing on the date of transfer, substantially
      equivalent to the Federal health and life insurance programs
      available to employees on the day before the date of transfer
      (except for officers of the Alaska Railroad, who shall receive
      such credit for one year following the date of transfer).

      (B) The State-owned railroad shall adopt all collective
    bargaining agreements which are in effect on the date of transfer.
    Such agreements shall continue in effect for the two-year period
    commencing on the date of transfer, unless the parties agree to the
    contrary before the expiration of that two-year period. Such
    agreements shall be renegotiated during the two-year period, unless
    the parties agree to the contrary. Any labor-management negotiation
    impasse declared before the date of transfer shall be settled in
    accordance with chapter 71 of title 5. Any impasse declared after
    the date of transfer shall be subject to applicable State law.
      (C) Federal service shall be included in the computation of

    transferred employee's base salary level provided by the United
    States as a cost-of-living allowance on the day before the date of
    transfer, unless the parties agree to the contrary.
      (E) Prior to the date of transfer, the Secretary shall also
    certify that the State-owned railroad has agreed to the retention,
    for at least one year from the date of transfer, of the offices of

    salaries in effect on the date of transfer, in such positions as
    the State-owned railroad may determine; or to the payment of lump-
    sum severance pay in an amount equal to such base salary for one
    year to officers not retained by the State-owned railroad upon
    transfer or, for officers separated within one year on or after the
    date of transfer, of a portion of such lump-sum severance payment

    within one year of the date of transfer prior to separation).
      (4) Prior to the date of transfer, the Secretary shall also
    certify that the State has agreed to allow representatives of the
    Secretary adequate access to employees and records of the Alaska
    Railroad when needed for the performance of functions related to

    Revolving Fund to be withheld from the State pursuant to section
    1202(10)(C) (!1) of this title, and any personal property to be
    withheld pursuant to section 1202(10)(D) (!1) of this title. The

    pursuant to section 1203(b)(1)(A), (B), and (D) of this title; (2)
    the rail properties to be subject to the license granted pursuant
    to section 1203(b)(1)(C) of this title; and (3) the easements to be

    Secretaries of Agriculture, Defense, and the Interior and the
    Administrator of the General Services Administration shall provide
    the Secretary with all information and assistance necessary to
    allow the Secretary to complete the report within the time
    required.

    (b) Inspection, etc., of rail properties and records; terms and
      conditions; restrictions
      During the period from January 14, 1983, until the date of

    photograph, photocopy and otherwise evaluate all of the rail
    properties of the Alaska Railroad and all records related to the
    rail properties of the Alaska Railroad maintained by any agency of
    the United States under conditions established by the Secretary to
    protect the confidentiality of proprietary business data, personnel
    records, and other information, the public disclosure of which is
    prohibited by law. During that period, the Secretary and the Alaska
    Railroad shall not, without the consent of the State and only in
    conformity with applicable law and the Memorandum of Understanding
    referred to in section 1205(b)(3) of this title - 
        (1) make or incur any obligation to make any individual capital
      expenditure of money from the Alaska Railroad Revolving Fund in
      excess of $300,000;
        (2) (except as required by law) sell, exchange, give, or
      otherwise transfer any real property included in the rail
      properties of the Alaska Railroad; or
        (3) lease any rail property of the Alaska Railroad for a term
      in excess of five years.
    (c) Format for accounting practices and systems
      Prior to transfer of the rail properties of the Alaska Railroad
    to the State, the Alaska Railroad's accounting practices and
    systems shall be capable of reporting data to the Interstate
    Commerce Commission in formats required of comparable rail carriers
    subject to the jurisdiction of the Interstate Commerce Commission.
    (d) Fair market value; determination, terms and conditions, etc.
      (1) Within nine months after January 14, 1983, the United States
    Railway Association (hereinafter in this section referred to as the
    "Association") shall determine the fair market value of the Alaska
    Railroad under the terms and conditions of this chapter, applying
    such procedures, methods and standards as are generally accepted as
    normal and common practice. Such determination shall include an
    appraisal of the real and personal property to be transferred to
    the State pursuant to this chapter. Such appraisal by the
    Association shall be conducted in the usual manner in accordance
    with generally accepted industry standards, and shall consider the
    current fair market value and potential future value if used in
    whole or in part for other purposes. The Association shall take
    into account all obligations imposed by this chapter and other
    applicable law upon operation and ownership of the State-owned
    railroad. In making such determination, the Association shall use
    to the maximum extent practicable all relevant data and
    information, including, if relevant, that contained in the report
    prepared pursuant to subsection (a) of this section.
      (2) The determination made pursuant to paragraph (1) of this
    subsection shall not be construed to affect, enlarge, modify, or
    diminish any inventory, valuation, or classification required by
    the Interstate Commerce Commission pursuant to subchapter V (!2) of
    chapter 107 of title 49.

    CHAPTER 21 - ALASKA RAILROAD TRANSFER

-HEAD-
    Sec. 1205. Lands to be transferred

-STATUTE-
    (a) Availability of lands among rail properties
      Lands among the rail properties of the Alaska Railroad shall not
    be - 
        (1) available for selection under section 12 of the Act of
      January 2, 1976, as amended (43 U.S.C. 1611, note), subject to
      the exception contained in section 12(b)(8)(i)(D) of such Act, as
      amended by subsection (d)(5) of this section;
        (2) available for conveyance under section 1425 of the Alaska
      National Interest Lands Conservation Act (Public Law 96-487; 94
      Stat. 2515);
        (3) available for conveyance to Chugach Natives, Inc., under
      sections 1429 or 1430 of the Alaska National Interest Lands
      Conservation Act (Public Law 96-487; 94 Stat. 2531) or under
      sections 12(c) or 14(h)(8) of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement
      Act (43 U.S.C. 1611(c) and 1613(h)(8), respectively); or
        (4) available under any law or regulation for entry, location,
      or for exchange by the United States, or for the initiation of a
      claim or selection by any party other than the State or other
      transferee under this chapter, except that this paragraph shall
      not prevent a conveyance pursuant to section 12(b)(8)(i)(D) of
      the Act of January 2, 1976 (43 U.S.C. 1611, note), as amended by
      subsection (d)(5) of this section.
    (b) Review and settlement of claims; administrative adjudication;
      management of lands; procedures applicable
      (1)(A) During the ten months following January 14, 1983, so far
    as practicable consistent with the priority of preparing the report
    required pursuant to section 1204(a) of this title, the Secretary
    of the Interior, Village Corporations with claims of valid existing
    rights, and the State shall review and make a good faith effort to
    settle as many of the claims as possible. Any agreement to settle
    such claims shall take effect and bind the United States, the
    State, and the Village Corporation only as of the date of transfer
    of the railroad.
      (B) At the conclusion of the review and settlement process
    provided in subparagraph (A) of this paragraph, the Secretary of
    the Interior shall prepare a report identifying lands to be
    conveyed in accordance with settlement agreements under this
    chapter or applicable law. Such settlement shall not give rise to a
    presumption as to whether a parcel of land subject to such
    agreement is or is not public land.
      (2) The Secretary of the Interior shall have the continuing
    jurisdiction and duty to adjudicate unresolved claims of valid
    existing rights pursuant to applicable law and this chapter. The
    Secretary of the Interior shall complete the final administrative
    adjudication required under this subsection not later than three
    years after January 14, 1983, and shall complete the survey of all
    lands to be conveyed under this chapter not later than five years
    after January 14, 1983, and after consulting with the Governor of
    the State of Alaska to determine priority of survey with regard to
    other lands being processed for patent to the State. The Secretary
    of the Interior shall give priority to the adjudication of Village
    Corporation claims as required in this section. Upon completion of
    the review and settlement process required by paragraph (1)(A) of
    this subsection, with respect to lands not subject to an agreement
    under such paragraph, the Secretary of the Interior shall
    adjudicate which lands subject to claims of valid existing rights
    filed by Village Corporations, if any, are public lands and shall
    complete such final administrative adjudication within two years
    after January 14, 1983.
      (3) Pending settlement or final administrative adjudication of
    claims of valid existing rights filed by Village Corporations prior
    to the date of transfer or while subject to the license granted to
    the State pursuant to section 1203(b)(1)(C) of this title, lands
    subject to such claims shall be managed in accordance with the
    Memorandum of Understanding among the Federal Railroad
    Administration, the State, Eklutna, Incorporated, Cook Inlet
    Region, Incorporated (as that term is used in section 12 of the Act
    of January 2, 1976 (Public Law 94-204; 89 Stat. 1150)), and
    Toghotthele Corporation, executed by authorized officers or
    representatives of each of these entities. Duplicate originals of
    the Memorandum of Understanding shall be maintained and made
    available for public inspection and copying in the Office of the
    Secretary, at Washington, District of Columbia, and in the Office
    of the Governor of the State of Alaska, at Juneau, Alaska.
      (4) The following procedures and requirements are established to
    promote finality of administrative adjudication of claims of valid
    existing rights filed by Village Corporations, to clarify and
    simplify the title status of lands subject to such claims, and to
    avoid potential impairment of railroad operations resulting from
    joint or divided ownership in substantial segments of right-of-way:
        (A)(i) Prior to final administrative adjudication of Village
      Corporation claims of valid existing rights in land subject to
      the license granted under section 1203(b)(1)(C) of this title,
      the Secretary of the Interior may, notwithstanding any other
      provision of law, accept relinquishment of so much of such claims
      as involved lands within the right-of-way through execution of an
      agreement with the appropriate Village Corporation effective on
      or after the date of transfer. Upon such relinquishment, the
      interest of the United States in the right-of-way shall be
      conveyed to the State pursuant to section 1203(b)(1)(B) or (2) of
      this title.
        (ii) With respect to a claim described in clause (i) of this
      subparagraph that is not settled or relinquished prior to final
      administrative adjudication, the Congress finds that exclusive
      control over the right-of-way by the Alaska Railroad has been and
      continues to be necessary to afford sufficient protection for
      safe and economic operation of the railroad. Upon failure of the
      interested Village Corporation to relinquish so much of its
      claims as involve lands within the right-of-way prior to final
      adjudication of valid existing rights, the Secretary shall convey
      to the State pursuant to section 1203(b)(1)(B) or (2) of this
      title all right, title and interest of the United States in and
      to the right-of-way free and clear of such Village Corporation's
      claim to and interest in lands within such right-of-way.
        (B) Where lands within the right-of-way, or any interest in
      such lands, have been conveyed from Federal ownership prior to
      January 14, 1983, or is subject to a claim of valid existing
      rights by a party other than a Village Corporation, the
      conveyance to the State of the Federal interest in such
      properties pursuant to section 1203(b)(1)(B) or (2) of this title
      shall grant not less than an exclusive-use easement in such
      properties. The foregoing requirements shall not be construed to
      permit the conveyance to the State of less than the entire
      Federal interest in the rail properties of the Alaska Railroad
      required to be conveyed by section 1203(b) of this title. If an
      action is commenced against the State or the United States
      contesting the validity or existence of a reservation of right-of-
      way for the use or benefit of the Alaska Railroad made prior to
      January 14, 1983, the Secretary of the Interior, through the
      Attorney General, shall appear in and defend such action.
    (c) Judicial review; remedies available; standing of State
      (1) The final administrative adjudication pursuant to subsection
    (b) of this section shall be final agency action and subject to
    judicial review only by an action brought in the United States
    District Court for the District of Alaska.
      (2) No administrative or judicial action under this chapter shall
    enjoin or otherwise delay the transfer of the Alaska Railroad
    pursuant to this chapter, or substantially impair or impede the
    operations of the Alaska Railroad or the State-owned railroad.
      (3) Before the date of transfer, the State shall have standing to
    participate in any administrative determination or judicial review
    pursuant to this chapter. If transfer to the State does not occur
    pursuant to section 1203 of this title, the State shall not
    thereafter have standing to participate in any such determination
    or review.
    (d) Omitted
    (e) Liability of State for damage to land while used under license
      The State shall be liable to a party receiving a conveyance of
    land among the rail properties of the Alaska Railroad subject to
    the license granted pursuant to section 1203(b)(1)(C) of this title
    for damage resulting from use by the State of the land under such
    license in a manner not authorized by such license.

    CHAPTER 21 - ALASKA RAILROAD TRANSFER

-HEAD-
    Sec. 1206. Employees of Alaska Railroad

-STATUTE-
    (a) Coverage under Federal civil service retirement laws; election,
      funding, nature of benefits, etc., for employees transferring to
      State-owned railroad; voluntary separation incentives
      (1) Any employees who elect to transfer to the State-owned
    railroad and who on the day before the date of transfer are subject
    to the civil service retirement law (subchapter III of chapter 83
    of title 5) shall, so long as continually employed by the State-
    owned railroad without a break in service, continue to be subject
    to such law, except that the State-owned railroad shall have the
    option of providing benefits in accordance with the provisions of
    paragraph (2) of this subsection. Employment by the State-owned
    railroad without a break in continuity of service shall be
    considered to be employment by the United States Government for
    purposes of subchapter III of chapter 83 of title 5. The State-
    owned railroad shall be the employing agency for purposes of
    section 8334(a) of title 5 and shall contribute to the Civil
    Service Retirement and Disability Fund a sum as provided by such
    section, except that such sum shall be determined by applying to
    the total basic pay (as defined in section 8331(3) of title 5) paid
    to the employees of the State-owned railroad who are covered by the
    civil service retirement law, the per centum rate determined
    annually by the Director of the Office of Personnel Management to
    be the excess of the total normal cost per centum rate of the civil
    service retirement system over the employee deduction rate
    specified in section 8334(a) of title 5. The State-owned railroad
    shall pay into the Federal Civil Service Retirement and Disability
    Fund that portion of the cost of administration of such Fund which
    is demonstrated by the Director of the Office of Personnel
    Management to be attributable to its employees.
      (2) At any time during the two-year period commencing on the date
    of transfer, the State-owned railroad shall have the option of
    providing to transferred employees retirement benefits, reflecting
    prior Federal service, in or substantially equivalent to benefits
    under the retirement program maintained by the State for State
    employees. If the State decides to provide benefits under this
    paragraph, the State shall provide such benefits to all transferred
    employees, except those employees who will meet the age and service
    requirements for retirement under section 8336(a), (b), (c) or (f)
    of title 5 within five years after the date of transfer and who
    elect to remain participants in the Federal retirement program.
      (3) If the State provides benefits under paragraph (2) of this
    subsection - 
        (A) the provisions of paragraph (1) of this subsection
      regarding payments into the Civil Service Retirement and
      Disability Fund for those employees who are transferred to the
      State program shall have no further force and effect (other than
      for employees who will meet the age and service requirements for
      retirement under section 8336(a), (b), (c) or (f) of title 5
      within five years after the date of transfer and who elect to
      remain participants in the Federal retirement program); and
        (B) all of the accrued employee and employer contributions and
      accrued interest on such contributions made by and on behalf of
      the transferred employees during their prior Federal service
      (other than amounts for employees who will meet the age and
      service requirements for retirement under section 8336(a), (b),
      (c) or (f) of title 5 within five years after the date of
      transfer and who elect to remain participants in the Federal
      retirement program) shall be withdrawn from the Federal Civil
      Service Retirement and Disability Fund and shall be paid into the
      retirement fund utilized by the State-owned railroad for the
      transferred employees, in accordance with the provisions of
      paragraph (2) of this subsection. Upon such payment, credit for
      prior Federal service under the Federal civil service retirement
      system shall be forever barred, notwithstanding the provisions of
      section 8334 of title 5.

      (4)(A) The State-owned railroad shall be included in the
    definition of "agency" for purposes of section 3(a), (b), (c), and
    (e) of the Federal Workforce Restructuring Act of 1994 and may
    elect to participate in the voluntary separation incentive program
    established under such Act. Any employee of the State-owned
    railroad who meets the qualifications as described under the first
    sentence of paragraph (1) shall be deemed an employee under such
    Act.
      (B) An employee who has received a voluntary separation incentive
    payment under this paragraph and accepts employment with the State-
    owned railroad within 5 years after the date of separation on

    TITLE 45 - RAILROADS
    CHAPTER 21 - ALASKA RAILROAD TRANSFER

-HEAD-
    Sec. 1207. State operation

-STATUTE-
    (a) Laws, authorities, etc., applicable to State-owned railroad
      with status as rail carrier engaged in interstate and foreign
      commerce
      (1) After the date of transfer to the State pursuant to section
    1203 of this title, the State-owned railroad shall be a rail
    carrier engaged in interstate and foreign commerce subject to part
    A of subtitle IV of title 49 and all other Acts applicable to rail
    carriers subject to that chapter,(!1) including the antitrust laws
    of the United States, except, so long as it is an instrumentality
    of the State of Alaska, the Railroad Retirement Act of 1974 (45
    U.S.C. 231 et seq.), the Railroad Retirement Tax Act (26 U.S.C.
    3201 et seq.), the Railway Labor Act (45 U.S.C. 151 et seq.), the
    Act of April 22, 1908 (45 U.S.C. 51 et seq.) (popularly referred to
    as the "Federal Employers' Liability Act"), and the Railroad
    Unemployment Insurance Act (45 U.S.C. 351 et seq.). Nothing in this
    chapter shall preclude the State from explicitly invoking by law
    any exemption from the antitrust laws as may otherwise be
    available.

      (2) The transfer to the State authorized by section 1203 of this
    title and the conferral of jurisdiction to the Interstate Commerce
    Commission pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subsection are
    intended to confer upon the State-owned railroad all business
    opportunities available to comparable railroads, including contract
    rate agreements meeting the requirements of section 10713 (!2) of
    title 49, notwithstanding any participation in such agreements by
    connecting water carriers.

      (3) All memoranda which sanction noncompliance with Federal
    railroad safety regulations contained in 49 CFR Parts 209-236, and
    which are in effect on the date of transfer, shall continue in
    effect according to their terms as "waivers of compliance" (as that
    term is used in section 20103(d) of title 49).
      (4) The operation of trains by the State-owned railroad shall not
    be subject to the requirement of any State or local law which
    specifies the minimum number of crew members which must be employed
    in connection with the operation of such trains.
      (5) Revenues generated by the State-owned railroad, including any
    amount appropriated or otherwise made available to the State-owned
    railroad, shall be retained and managed by the State-owned railroad
    for railroad and related purposes.
      (6)(A) After the date of transfer, continued operation of the
    Alaska Railroad by a public corporation, authority or other agency
    of the State shall be deemed to be an exercise of an essential
    governmental function, and revenue derived from such operation
    shall be deemed to accrue to the State for the purposes of section
    115(a)(1) of title 26. Obligations issued by such entity shall also
    be deemed obligations of the State for the purposes of section
    103(a)(1) (!2) of title 26, but not obligations within the meaning
    of section 103(b)(2) (!2) of title 26.
      (B) Nothing in this chapter shall be deemed or construed to
    affect customary tax treatment of private investment in the
    equipment or other assets that are used or owned by the State-owned
    railroad.
    (b) Procedures for issuance of certificate of public convenience
      and necessity; inventory, valuation, or classification of
      property; additional laws, authorities, etc., applicable
      As soon as practicable after January 14, 1983, the Interstate
    Commerce Commission shall promulgate an expedited, modified
    procedure for providing on the date of transfer a certificate of
    public convenience and necessity to the State-owned railroad. No
    inventory, valuation, or classification of property owned or used
    by the State-owned railroad pursuant to subchapter V (!2) of
    chapter 107 of title 49 shall be required during the two-year
    period after the date of transfer. The provisions of the National
    Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.) and
    section 382(b) of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act (42 U.S.C.
    6362(b)) shall not apply to actions of the Commission under this
    subsection.
    (c) Eligibility for participation in Federal railroad assistance
      programs
      The State-owned railroad shall be eligible to participate in all
    Federal railroad assistance programs on a basis equal to that of
    other rail carriers subject to part A of subtitle IV of title 49.
    (d) Laws and regulations applicable to national forest and park
      lands; limitations on Federal actions
      After the date of transfer to the State pursuant to section 1203
    of this title, the portion of the rail properties within the
    boundaries of the Chugach National Forest and the exclusive-use
    easement within the boundaries of the Denali National Park and
    Preserve shall be subject to laws and regulations for the
    protection of forest and park values. The right to fence the
    exclusive-use easement within Denali National Park and Preserve
    shall be subject to the concurrence of the Secretary of the
    Interior. The Secretary of the Interior, or the Secretary of
    Agriculture where appropriate, shall not act pursuant to this
    subsection without consulting with the Governor of the State of
    Alaska or in such a manner as to unreasonably interfere with
    continued or expanded operations and support functions authorized
    under this chapter.
    (e) Preservation and protection of rail properties
      The State-owned railroad may take any necessary or appropriate
    action, consistent with Federal railroad safety laws, to preserve
    and protect its rail properties in the interests of safety.

-HEAD-
    Sec. 1301. Findings

-STATUTE-
      The Congress finds that - 
        (1) the bankruptcy of the Penn Central and other railroads in
      the Northeast and Midwest resulted in a transportation emergency
      which required the intervention of the Federal Government;
        (2) the United States Government created the Consolidated Rail
      Corporation, which provides essential rail service to the
      Northeast and Midwest;
        (3) the future of rail service in the Northeast and Midwest is
      essential and must be protected through rail service obligations,
      consistent with the transfer of the Corporation to the private
      sector;
        (4) the Northeast Rail Service Act of 1981 has achieved its
      purpose in allowing the Corporation to become financially self-
      sustaining;
        (5) the Federal Government has invested over $7,000,000,000 in
      providing rail service to the Northeast and Midwest;
        (6) the Government, as a result of its ownership and investment
      of taxpayer dollars in the Corporation, controls substantial
      assets, including cash of approximately $1,000,000,000;
        (7) the Corporation's viability and sound performance allow it
      to be sold to the American public for a substantial sum through a
      public offering;
        (8) a public offering of the Corporation's stock will preserve
      competitive rail service in the region, provide a reasonable
      return to the Government, and protect employment;
        (9) the Corporation's employees contributed significantly to
      the turnaround in the Corporation's financial performance and
      they should share in the Corporation's success through a
      settlement of their claims for reimbursement for wages below
      industry standard, and a share in the common equity of the
      Corporation;
        (10) the requirements of section 761(e) (!1) of this title are
      met by this chapter; and

        (11) the Secretary of Transportation has discharged the
      responsibilities of the Department of Transportation under the
      Northeast Rail Service Act of 1981 with respect to the sale of
      the Corporation as a single entity.

    Sec. 1312. Public offering

-STATUTE-
    (a) Structure of public offering
      (1) After the registration statement referred to in section
    1311(c) of this title is declared effective by the Securities and
    Exchange Commission, the Secretary of Transportation, in
    consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury, the Chairman of
    the Board of Directors of the Corporation, and the co-lead
    managers, shall offer the United States shares for sale in a public
    offering, except as provided in paragraphs (2) and (3).
      (2) The Secretary of Transportation, after such consultation, may
    elect to offer less than all of the United States shares for sale
    at the time of the initial sale.
      (3) Under no circumstances shall the Secretary of Transportation
    offer any of the United States shares for sale unless, before the
    sale date, the Secretary determines, after such consultation, that
    the estimated sum of the gross proceeds from the sale of all the
    United States shares will be an adequate amount. A determination by
    the Secretary under this paragraph shall not be reviewable.
      (4) In making a determination under paragraph (3), the Secretary
    shall have the goal of obtaining at least $2,000,000,000 in
    aggregate gross proceeds for the United States from the public
    offering and any payments made under section 1311(b) of this title.
    (b) Subsequent sales
      If the Secretary of Transportation elects to offer for sale less
    than all the United States shares, the Secretary shall sell the
    remaining United States shares in subsequent public offerings.
    (c) Consent of Corporation not required
      Any public offering under this section may be made without the
    consent of the Corporation.
    (d) Authority to require stock splits
      (1) The Secretary of Transportation, in consultation with the co-
    lead managers and the Chairman of the Board of Directors of the
    Corporation, may, in connection with the initial public offering
    described in subsection (a) of this section, before the filing of
    the registration statement referred to in section 1311(c) of this
    title, require the Corporation to declare a stock split or reverse
    stock split.
      (2) The Corporation shall take such action as may be necessary to
    comply with the Secretary's requirements under this subsection.
    (e) Cancellation of other securities held by United States
      (1) In consideration for amounts transferred to the United States
    under section 1311(b) of this title, the Secretary of
    Transportation shall, concurrent with the initial public offering
    described in subsection (a) of this section, deliver to the
    Corporation all preferred stock, 7.5 percent debentures, and
    contingent interest notes of the Corporation. The Corporation shall
    immediately cancel such debentures, preferred stock, and contingent
    interest notes, and any interest of the United States in such
    debentures, preferred stock, and contingent interest notes shall be
    thereby extinguished.
      (2) For purposes of regulation by the Commission and State public
    utility regulation, the actions authorized by this subsection, the
    public offering, and the value of the consideration received
    therefor shall not change the value of the Corporation's assets net
    of depreciation and shall not be used to alter the calculation of
    the Corporation's stock or asset values, rate base, expenses,
    costs, returns, profits, or revenues, or otherwise affect or be the
    basis for a change in the regulation of any railroad service, rate,
    or practice provided or established by the Corporation, or any
    change in the financial reporting practice of the Corporation.
    (f) Minority investment banking firms
      The Secretary of Transportation shall ensure that minority owned
    or controlled investment banking firms shall have an opportunity to
    participate to a significant degree in any public offering under
    this subchapter.
    (g) Investment banking firm requirements
      (1) The level of any investment banking firm's participation in
    the public offering shall be consistent with that firm's financial
    capabilities.
      (2) No investment banking firm which was not in existence on
    September 1, 1986, shall participate in the public offering.
    (h) Government Accountability Office authority to conduct audits
      The Government Accountability Office may make such audits as may
    be deemed appropriate by the Comptroller General of the United
    States of all accounts, books, records, memoranda, correspondence,
    and other documents and transactions of the Corporation and the co-
    lead managers associated with the public offering. The co-lead
    managers shall agree, in writing, to allow the Government
    Accountability Office to make such audits. The Government
    Accountability Office shall report the results of all such audits
    to the Congress.

    Such certificate shall include audited consolidated financial

    certify that, after giving effect to any such dividend, the
    Corporation shall be in compliance with any requirement regarding a

    Sec. 1347. Tax treatment of Conrail public sale

-STATUTE-
    (a) Treatment as new corporation
      (1) In general
        For periods after the public sale, for purposes of title 26,
      Conrail shall be treated as a new corporation which purchased all
      of its assets as of the beginning of the day after the date of
      the public sale for an amount equal to the deemed purchase price.
      (2) Allocation among assets
        The deemed purchase price shall be allocated among the assets
      of Conrail in accordance with the temporary regulations
      prescribed under section 338 of title 26 (as such regulations
      were in effect on October 21, 1986). The Secretary shall
      establish specific guidelines for carrying out the preceding
      sentence so that the basis of each asset will be clearly
      ascertainable. For purposes of applying the regulations referred
      to in the first sentence, accounts receivable and materials and
      supplies shall be treated as cash equivalents.
      (3) Deemed purchase price
        For purposes of this subsection, the deemed purchase price is
      an amount equal to the gross amount received pursuant to the
      public sale, multiplied by a fraction - 
          (A) the numerator of which is 100 percent, and
          (B) the denominator of which is the percentage (by value) of
        the stock of Conrail sold in the public sale.

      The amount determined under the preceding sentence shall be
      adjusted under regulations prescribed by the Secretary for
      liabilities of Conrail and other relevant items.
    (b) No income from cancellation of debt or preferred stock
      No amount shall be included in the gross income of any person by
    reason of any cancellation of any obligation (or preferred stock)
    of Conrail in connection with the public sale.
    (c) Disallowance of certain deductions
      No deduction shall be allowed to Conrail for any amount which is
    paid after the date of the public sale to employees of Conrail for
    services performed on or before the date of the public sale.
    (d) Waiver of certain employee stock ownership plan provisions
      For purposes of determining whether the employee stock ownership
    plans of Conrail meet the qualifications of sections 401 and 501 of
    title 26 - 
        (1) the limits of section 415 of such title (relating to
      limitations on benefits and contributions under qualified plans)
      shall not apply with respect to interests in stock transferred
      pursuant to this Act or a law heretofore enacted, and
        (2) the 2-year waiting period for withdrawals shall not apply
      to withdrawals of amounts (or shares) in participants accounts in
      connection with the public sale.
    (e) Definitions
      For purposes of this section - 
      (1) Conrail
        The term "Conrail" means the Consolidated Rail Corporation.
      Such term includes any corporation which was a subsidiary of
      Conrail immediately before the public sale.
      (2) Public sale
        The term "public sale" means the sale of stock in Conrail
      pursuant to a public offering under the Conrail Privatization Act
      [45 U.S.C. 1301 et seq.]. If there is more than 1 public offering
      under such Act, such term means the sale pursuant to the initial
      public offering under such Act.
      (3) Secretary
        The term "Secretary" means the Secretary of the Treasury or his
      delegate.
